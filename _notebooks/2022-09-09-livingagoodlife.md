# Psychology and the Good Life

Basically, this video talks about the prevalence of stress and anxiety among students across many colleges and the need
to reform their attitudes in order to live a good life. It's clear that it's not healthy for so many students to be 
stressed about going to a good college because they're missing out on so many of the opportunities that they came there 
for in the first place. 

## Personal Experiences

Personally, I can relate to some of the feelings that these students go through. I sometimes feel stressed when I have a lot 
of work to get done, feeling overwhelmed by everything I have to do. But I can't even imagine what'd it be like to have to 
experience that all the time. So I do think that it's necessary to make sure that those students are actually enjoying their 
lives in college.
