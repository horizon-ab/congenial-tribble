Although I literally copied and pasted the code to print the actual poem, most of the new stuff comes from the static 2d ArrayList, which adds the monkey from each new instance to it, making it easy to edit. You can also get rid of a monkey at the very end (or at a specific index) and you can print out the individual monkey stored in one of the objects. Pretty efficient in my opinion.\n",
