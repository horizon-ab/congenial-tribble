    "The first FRQ primarily focuses around methods and control structures, which isn't too bad as far as I'm concerned. Methods are about the specific functions an object can perform, whereas control structures are mainly about the if, elseif, and else statemements that can branch a program out into different pathways. These are quite fundamental concepts for the Java language, so I think I know them pretty well already.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's never a good idea to underestimate the difficulty of these questions, as these can easily make or break a 5 on the exam. That's why I'll be practicing them today in this blog."

    "## The Process\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first time solving an FRQ, I don't think it was too bad (although I had a pretty big handicap with being able to test solutions).\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part wasn't too hard; the iteration was a bit different but I eventually came upon a solution to my problems. Troubleshooting it was probably the hardest part though. Finding the subtle mistakes that I made in the process was painful, even with the ability to compile. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second part was pretty easy aside from one part. It was easy enough to compare the two values using the previous scoreGuess() function, but I didn't know how to compare alphabetically. I was completely stuck and I was even considering using a for loop to iterate through each letter, but eventually I realized that the compareTo() method existed for Strings, and that basically solved the problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, I think I did a decent job. Obviously it isn't good enough for the AP Exam, but I think I can definitely get the hang of creating solutions like these pretty quickly in the future. "
