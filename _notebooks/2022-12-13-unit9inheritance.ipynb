    "\n",
    "- Classes are allowed to inherit attributes and methods from other classes using the \"extends\" keyword\n",
    "  - Class inheriting is the child class, class being inherited from is the parent class\n",
    "- super() can be used to call methods (and constructors) from the parent class inside the child class\n",
    "  - Subclass constructor can use super() to quickly set attributes originally from the parent class\n",
    "- Polymorphism\n",
    "  - Child class can be treated as an instance of its parent class (referencing superclass of object)\n",
    "    - Child won't be able to access its own methods this way\n",
    "  - Methods can be overriden with new definitions\n",
    "    - @Override keyword\n",
    "  - Methods can be overloaded with different function signatures\n",
    "    - Same name, different parameters\n",
    "- Late binding - Methods are searched for by the compiler during runtime, not during the compilation of the code. Think about overriding the method\n",
    "- Abstract class + methods\n",
    "  - Abstraction\n",
    "  - Cannot create an object from it directly, must be created using a child class inheriting from the abstract class\n",
    "  - Abstract methods originally only have their signature created and must be fully established in the child class definition\n",
    "- Standard methods - methods inherited from the original Object class\n",
    "  - toString() - will usually print out the memory address of an object, can be overriden to print more specific information about the object in question\n",
    "  - equals() - checks if two objects are equal using \"==\" (which checks if the two memory addresses point to the same object); can also be overriden for more specific terms of being equal\n",
    "  - hashCode() - generates a unique numeric ID for each object, which can be used to check if they're equal to one another; can also be overriden for more specific terms"
