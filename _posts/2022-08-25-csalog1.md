# GitHub

GitHub is an online open source service for software development, and it's one of the main softwares used in AP CSA.
Mainly, it serves to control the version history of the many files in a project.

# How does GitHub work?

GitHub organizes projects into repositories, which are the main centers of controlling versions.
When changes are made to one of the files, a programmer must make a "push" request (along with a quick message about it), which is basically asking the repository to review the changes and accept it, which is called "committing". 
This is pretty useful for larger programs, as it's important to keep track of all the changes made to a software (in case catastrophic errors occur in a sea of files). Though, on a smaller scale, it's more tedious.
GitHub can be linked to other softwares such as VSCode in order to make changes and push requests directly from there.

# Summary

GitHub is pretty useful. üëç
