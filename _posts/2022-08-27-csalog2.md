# The AP Computer Science A Exam

This exam will basically determine if I get credit for this class or not, so it's good to see how this test is actually broken down.

The exam lasts a total of 3 hours, and is broken into two portions:
- Multiple Choice
- Free Response

## Multiple Choice

The multiple choice segment, as its name suggests, is a bunch of multiple choice questions (40 in total) about programming. It's worth 50%
of the total exam, lasting for 1 hour and 30 minutes. The questions are usually individual, though 1 or 2 sets will appear (which have 2 questions).

## Free Response

The free response segment consists of 4 questions about code implementation:
- Question 1 deals with methods and control structures
- Question 2 deals with classes
- Question 3 deals with arrays and arraylists
- Question 4 deals with 2d arrays

This section also is worth 50% of the exam and lasts 1 hour and 30 minutes.
