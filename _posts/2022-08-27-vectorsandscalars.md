# Vectors vs. Scalars

AP Physics is quite a daunting class, so it's good to make note of the very important differences between certain concepts.
Vectors and scalars are basically present in every single measurement taken in that class, so I think it'd be a good idea
to distinguish between the two here.

# Vectors

Vectors are magnitude + direction.

It describes a quantity that is in a certain direction. Examples include velocity and acceleration.

# Scalars

Scalars are magnitude.

It describes a quantity that cannot be measured with a certain direction in mind. Examples include length and time.
