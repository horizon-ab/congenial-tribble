# Arrays

Arrays are an important structure to understand, as they appear on the AP Exam as one of the FRQs. But, what exactly are 
arrays in Java?

## Definition

Arrays can store multiples values of a datatype, indicated by the form:

"type[] arrayName;"

Various values can be stored within, making it a useful tool to handle large amounts of data.

## For and while loops

Arrays can also be transversed, iterated, and mutated through for and while loops. Using these loops, each element inside the array 
can be accessed and/or changed somehow. It's way easier than just using a million variables and going through each one.

To access each value, simply use the square brackets along with the index (which starts from 0). An example of accessing something at 
index 2 would like like this

"arrayOfNumbers\[2\];"

## Conclusion

Arrays are useful for handling large amounts of data neatly.
