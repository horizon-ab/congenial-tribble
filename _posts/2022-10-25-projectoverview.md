# The Idea: Science Olympiad Website

Science Olympiad is a nationwide competition which hosts competitions centering around science, whether it be in anatomy, astronomy, forestry, forensics, and more. Many students come and compete in these competitions from all over the nation, going from regional, to state, all the way to national.

As a matter of fact, Del Norte happens to have one of these Science Olympiad teams at its school. Unfortunately, the official website for the team is not great:

Since 2 members of our group are in Science Olympiad (including myself), we decided to partner up with another team in period 1 to rebuild the entire website from the ground up to ensure that all of its members don't have to suffer through bad GUI.

## Game Plan

So how are we going to rebuild this website?

It's quite a daunting task, so we decided to split the entire website up into a bunch of systems we need to implement, including but not limited to:
- Login Function
- Event Lists
- Student Lists
- Event Material API
- Search Bar
- etc.
