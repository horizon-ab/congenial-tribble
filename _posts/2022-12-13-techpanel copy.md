## Conclusion

This panel helped me learn that actually making ideas into reality within the tech industry require massive amounts of work and different components for each individual company. Everyone has their own, unique part to play: some people will be directly coding while others will be managing those people. The sheer amount of work put into these kinds of projects has also made me realize how important the tech industry is to our world today: without their hard work to improve society we wouldn't be living lives as nice as ours currently. It's easy to think that anyone could just write a lot of code on their own and turn their idea into something tangible that will help others, but that just isn't realistic. I think our CSA class lets us work in a much more realistic environment. Instead of programming everything ourselves on smaller, less useful projects that don't do much, we have tables that can program together to make a bigger, useful project that can benefit us. It actually sets us up for the real world of computer science.
