## Brief Introduction

This is a presentation from CSU San Marcos graduates Ashley and John about the various aspects and opportunities to be found at CSU.

## Speakers

- Ashley
  - D in AP Physics but persisted because of enjoyment
  - Failed a lot of courses but never let them define her 

- John
  - Started at Palomar College
    - Pretty cheap
  - Transferred to CSUSM
  - Associatees in physics and computer science
  - Took 6 years to get bachelor's degree

- Computer science is really important
  - Present in every field

- CSUSM
  - Relatively new college
  - Leading in social mobility
  - Pathways
    - Computer science, Biological sciences, Electrial Engineering, Chemistry
    - Easy to transition from one to the other
  - Departments
    - Physics, Chemsistry and Biochemistry, Math, Computer Science, etc.
  - Clubs
    - Cybersecurity, Robotics
  - Internships
    - Period of work experience for limited time
    - Find by:
      - Joining clubs
      - Check emails
      - Go to campus events
      - Search up online
    - Avoid unpaid internships, apply even if you feel underqualified, ask faculty for help
  - Programs
    - Summer Scholars Program, Quantum Bridge Program
  - Research

  - Paying for college
    - Two loan types
      - Subsidized - doesn't accrue interest while in school at elase half0time or during deferrment periods
      - Direct Unsubsidized - Accrues interest in school and during grace periods
      - Pay them 6 months after graduating, though there aare optiosn for those struggling and those going to graduate school
    - Finding scholarships
      - Search for them yourself (online)

    - You can even get paid to get master's

## Conclusion

I learned that there will always be opportunities to grow and learn in basically any field outside high school. As a current junior, the pressure to get into a good college to learn good computer science is ramping up signficantly. And I feel that myself and a lot of other peers have felt anxious and stressed about these college decisions. But after hearing Ashley and John talk, I realize now that there's always going to be great opportunities to become a good coder. Even if I don't go to an Ivy-tier university like Stanford, I can still learn a lot at nearby universities like CSU at San Marcos. There'll be opportunities like the Quantum Bridge Program and the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Lab where you can learn so much practical and applied ways to use computer science. Plus, there'll be scholarships, financial aid, and paid internships to help with the cost of living. And continuing into graduate school, you can even get sponsorships from companies to help get your master's in computer science. Really, there are many, many ways to learn the skills necessary to succeed in the field of computer science, and it can be anywhere from a prestigious university like Stanford or even a local university like CSU.
