            "content": "Overview . ChatGPT is a pretty useful AI model to access in your code without having to create your own model. Essentially, this tutorial will give you a pretty good idea of how to directly access the API in Java. . Steps: . Get access to an API Key | Store the API Key securely in the code | Create a fetch request to the API in Java | And that&#39;s really it. . Step 1: Get access to an API Key . Basically, not just anybody can access the ChatGPT API; you need a secret key to be allowed access to the API. Luckily, it&#39;s pretty easy to get one. . Create an Open AI account (link here). | Go to your personal list of API keys (link here). | Select &quot;create new secret key&quot; | Copy the given API key and store it somewhere | Note: Make sure to store the API key in somewhere safe, but you CANNOT leave this key in plaintext in a file and push it to the Github repository. Open AI will automatically detect the presence of this key and disable it for security reasons. If this ever happens, just create a new secret key. There are no penalties for this. . Step 2: Store the API Key securely in the code . If you want to just have fun accessing ChatGPT from Java without using it in a final deployed project, you can just skip this step. This step is only necessary if you want to access ChatGPT safely and securely for a deployed project. . Unfortunately, this was the most painful part of getting everything to work. There are really two ways of doing this that we know of. The first involves storing the API key inside the Github repository and directly accessing it inside the code. The second involves adding a plaintext file with the API key onto AWS and using a file reader to access the key. . In theory, the first method should be the correct way to do things, but we couldn&#39;t get it to work for whatever reason. The steps will be listed below, but if you want a method that&#39;s guaranteed to work (though may be slightly scuffed) you can just skip these. . Go to the backend Github repository. | Access settings (note that only contributers with admin permissions are allowed to access settings). | |",

            "content": "Brief Introduction . This is a presentation from CSU San Marcos graduates Ashley and John about the various aspects and opportunities to be found at CSU. . Speakers . Ashley D in AP Physics but persisted because of enjoyment | Failed a lot of courses but never let them define her | . | John Started at Palomar College Pretty cheap | . | Transferred to CSUSM | Associatees in physics and computer science | Took 6 years to get bachelor’s degree | . | Computer science is really important Present in every field | . | CSUSM Relatively new college | Leading in social mobility | Pathways Computer science, Biological sciences, Electrial Engineering, Chemistry | Easy to transition from one to the other | . | Departments Physics, Chemsistry and Biochemistry, Math, Computer Science, etc. | . | Clubs Cybersecurity, Robotics | . | Internships Period of work experience for limited time | Find by: Joining clubs | Check emails | Go to campus events | Search up online | . | Avoid unpaid internships, apply even if you feel underqualified, ask faculty for help | . | Programs Summer Scholars Program, Quantum Bridge Program | . | Research Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Lab, California Primary Algae Laboratory, Arithmetic Dynamics in Math, Cancer Cell Research | . | Paying for college Two loan types Subsidized - doesn’t accrue interest while in school at elase half0time or during deferrment periods | Direct Unsubsidized - Accrues interest in school and during grace periods | Pay them 6 months after graduating, though there aare optiosn for those struggling and those going to graduate school | . | Finding scholarships Search for them yourself (online) | . | . | Scholarships and Grants Apply for FAFSA, studentaid.gov | Check student email, search online | Financial aid office | . | . | Life After CSUSM Internships | Graduate school You can even get paid to get master’s | . | . | . Conclusion . I learned that there will always be opportunities to grow and learn in basically any field outside high school. As a current junior, the pressure to get into a good college to learn good computer science is ramping up signficantly. And I feel that myself and a lot of other peers have felt anxious and stressed about these college decisions. But after hearing Ashley and John talk, I realize now that there’s always going to be great opportunities to become a good coder. Even if I don’t go to an Ivy-tier university like Stanford, I can still learn a lot at nearby universities like CSU at San Marcos. There’ll be opportunities like the Quantum Bridge Program and the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Lab where you can learn so much practical and applied ways to use computer science. Plus, there’ll be scholarships, financial aid, and paid internships to help with the cost of living. And continuing into graduate school, you can even get sponsorships from companies to help get your master’s in computer science. Really, there are many, many ways to learn the skills necessary to succeed in the field of computer science, and it can be anywhere from a prestigious university like Stanford or even a local university like CSU. .",

            "title": "Data Types",
            "content": "Data Types in Java . Before discussing Data Structures it is important to review Data Types and the AP Methods and Control Structures topic. To begin this discussion I asked ChatGPT, &quot;what are Java data types&quot; and was really happy with the answer ... . In Java, data types are used to define the type of data that a variable can hold. There are two main categories of data types in Java: primitive data types and reference data types. . Primitive data types: . byte: 8-bit signed integer (-128 to 127) | short: 16-bit signed integer (-32,768 to 32,767) | int: 32-bit signed integer (-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647) | long: 64-bit signed integer (-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807) | float: 32-bit floating-point number (1.4e-45 to 3.4e+38) | double: 64-bit floating-point number (4.9e-324 to 1.8e+308) | boolean: true or false | char: 16-bit Unicode character (0 to 65,535) | . | Reference data types: . Objects: instances of classes | Arrays: a collection of data of the same type. | . | . | Primitive data types are stored directly in memory, whereas reference data types are stored as a reference to a memory location where the actual data is stored. . | . This led to follow up question, &quot;what about Java Wrapper data types&quot; and this answer even corrected my language to say wrapper classes ... . Java Wrapper classes are classes that provide a way to use primitive data types as objects. They are called wrapper classes because they &quot;wrap&quot; the primitive data types into an object. . There are eight wrapper classes in Java, each corresponding to one of the primitive data types: | Byte: represents a byte value | Short: represents a short value | Integer: represents an int value | Long: represents a long value | Float: represents a float value | Double: represents a double value | Boolean: represents a boolean value | Character: represents a char value | . | Wrapper classes are often used when working with collections or other APIs that require objects rather than primitive data types. They also provide methods for converting between primitive data types and their corresponding object types, as well as methods for performing operations on the wrapped values. . | . As an addendum to ChatGPT definition of a Wrapper Class, it is critical to understand assignments. When you assign a value to a wrapper class object, Java automatically creates a new instance of the wrapper class and assigns the value to it. Thus, every assignment is a new object!!! This process is called Auto-boxing. For example, to assign an integer value to an Integer object ... . // Both of these create new objects Integer n = 5; // Auto-boxing, Integer n = new Integer(5); n += 5; // Auto-boxing, Integer n = new Integer(n + 5); . For clarification, for my students I asked, &quot;define reference data types&quot;. This added a purpose to the name reference ... . In Java, reference data types are data types that hold references or memory addresses that point to objects. These data types do not actually contain the data they refer to, but instead, store a reference to the memory location where the data is stored. . | Reference data types are used to store complex data structures such as objects and arrays. Objects are instances of classes that encapsulate data and behavior, while arrays are collections of data of the same type. . | When a reference data type variable is declared, memory is allocated for the reference variable itself, but not for the object or array it refers to. Memory for the object or array is allocated separately using the &quot;new&quot; keyword, and the reference variable is assigned the memory address of the object or array. . | *Reference data types are passed by reference, which means that when a reference variable is passed as a method argument, the method receives a copy of the reference, but both the original reference and the copy point to the same object in memory. This allows methods to modify the object or array that the reference points to***. . | . For completeness on this discussion I asked, &quot;define primitive data types&quot; ... . In Java, primitive data types are the basic building blocks of data that can hold a single value of a specific type. They are called &quot;primitive&quot; because they are not objects and do not have any methods or properties like objects do. . | There are eight primitive data types in Java: . byte: 8-bit signed integer (-128 to 127) | short: 16-bit signed integer (-32,768 to 32,767) | int: 32-bit signed integer (-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647) | long: 64-bit signed integer (-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807) | float: 32-bit floating-point number | double: 64-bit floating-point number | boolean: true or false | char: 16-bit Unicode character (0 to 65,535) | . | Primitive data types are stored directly in memory and are passed by value, which means that when a primitive data type variable is passed as a method argument, the method receives a copy of the value, not a reference to the original variable. This also means that modifying the value of a primitive data type variable inside a method does not affect the original value of the variable outside the method. . | . Data Types behaviors . The AP exam will have questions about &quot;primitives&quot;, &quot;wrapper classes&quot;, and &quot;reference&quot; and how they work in relation to &quot;pass by value&quot;, and &quot;pass by reference&quot;. . A primitive Data Type &quot;int&quot; showing pass by value . The primitive int data type. This code shows behavior as it is passed to method and the value is changed. . public class PassByValue { public static void changeInt(int n) { System.out.println(&quot;In changeInt method&quot;); System.out.println(&quot; tBefore n += 10: n = &quot; + n); // prints 5 n = n += 10; System.out.println(&quot; tAfter n += 10: n = &quot; + n); // prints 10 } public static void main(String[] args) { int n = 5; System.out.println(&quot;Main method before changeInt(n): n = &quot; + n); // prints 5 changeInt(n); System.out.println(&quot;Main method after changeInt(n): n = &quot; + n); // still prints 5 } } PassByValue.main(null); . Main method before changeInt(n): n = 5 In changeInt method Before n += 10: n = 5 After n += 10: n = 15 Main method after changeInt(n): n = 5 . The wrapper Integer class (by value or reference?) . An object wrapper class Integer for the primitive int data type. TWhen an Integer object is passed as a parameter to a method, the object is passed as a class. How does assignment behave in this example? By value or by reference? Observe the hashCode(), we will compare it to the next example. . public class PassByValueOrReference { public static void changeInteger(Integer n) { System.out.println(&quot;In changeInteger method&quot;); System.out.println(&quot; tBefore change: n = &quot; + n + // prints 5 &quot; hash code = &quot; + n.hashCode()); n += 10; // behind the scenes, this is: n = new Integer(n+10) System.out.println(&quot; tAfter change: n = &quot; + n + // prints 15 &quot; hash code = &quot; + n.hashCode()); } public static void main(String[] args) { Integer n = 5; System.out.println(&quot;Main method before changeInteger(n): n = &quot; + n + // prints 5 &quot; hash code = &quot; + n.hashCode()); changeInteger(n); System.out.println(&quot;Main method after changeInteger(n): n = &quot; + n + // now prints 15 &quot; hash code = &quot; + n.hashCode()); } PassByValueOrReference.main(null); . Main method before changeInteger(n): n = 5 In changeInteger method Before change: n = 5 hash code = 5 After change: n = 15 hash code = 15 Main method after changeInteger(n): n = 5 . The class AtomicInteger . A class AtomicInteger for the primitive int data type. When an AtomicInteger object is passed as a parameter to a method, the object is passed as a Java class. The only way to change the data with a class is to use the setters and getters of the Object. The hashCode() show a unique object number and it maintains consistency through as the referenced data being changed by the setter. . import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger; public class PassByReference { public static void changeAtomicInteger(AtomicInteger n) { System.out.println(&quot;In changeAtomicInteger method&quot;); System.out.println(&quot; tBefore change: n = &quot; + n + // prints 5 &quot; hash code = &quot; + n.hashCode()); n.set(n.get() + 10); // at this point, we are clearly working with reference data type System.out.println(&quot; tAfter change: n = &quot; + n + // prints 15 &quot; hash code = &quot; + n.hashCode()); } public static void main(String[] args) { AtomicInteger n = new AtomicInteger(5); // unlike conventional wrapper class, this requires new System.out.println(&quot;Main method before changeAtomicInteger(n): n = &quot; + n + // prints 5 &quot; hash code = &quot; + n.hashCode()); changeAtomicInteger(n); System.out.println(&quot;Main method after changeAtomicInteger(n): n = &quot; + n + // now prints 15 &quot; hash code = &quot; + n.hashCode()); } } PassByReference.main(null); . Main method before changeAtomicInteger(n): n = 5 hash code = 747820531 In changeAtomicInteger method Before change: n = 5 hash code = 747820531 After change: n = 15 hash code = 747820531 Main method after changeAtomicInteger(n): n = 15 hash code = 747820531 .

Datatypes . There are 2 main datatypes present in the above code, which are: . ints | doubles | . Certain datatypes are better suited than others to model a situation; since the situation includes the distance per hop, the maximum distance, and the max number of hops are all whole numbers, ints are preferrable to use here. . However, considering the output of runSimulations() being a ratio, a different datatype would be better suited: a double. . Methods and Control Structures . Control structures form the building blocks of most methods, allowing them to handle simple tasks such as filtering or calculating. In this case, the main methods are simulate() and runSimulations(). . simulate() utilizes both for loops, in order to iterate through the hops and their effect on distance, and if loops, in order to check if any one of the return conditions are met (negative distance, max hops, or reached distance). . runSimulations() also takes advantage of for loops in order to run simulate() numerous times, using an if statement to distinguish between successful and unsuccessful simulations. . Quiz Corrections . Overall, I got 38/39. . Question 3 . public class A { public show() { System.out.println(&quot;A&quot;); } } public class B extends A { public show() { System.out.println(&quot;B&quot;); } } A obj = new B(); B.show(); . I thought that, since obj was specifically given the type A, that it would print out &quot;A&quot; when show() is called. But since the type used to fill up the A datatype requirement is B, then the method from B is used, so when show() is called &quot;B&quot; is printed. .",

            "content": "52 Question Test . Score: 50/52 . This test was essentially a long distance marathon in terms of its questions and length. The questions weren’t too hard in my opinion, but they took a long time to finish, especially when going through dozens of them in a single sitting. I took 83 minutes to finish, so I could definitely have done better with the timing, though I got a good score from it. Looking at my mistakes (2), I think I’m actually pretty good overall, though I can make silly mistakes when visualizing loops and forget certain obscure features of Java. . Question . int a = 1988; int b = 1990; String claim = &quot; that the world’s athletes &quot; + &quot;competed in Olympic Games in &quot;; String s = &quot;It is &quot; + true + claim + a + &quot; but &quot; + false + claim + b + &quot;.&quot;; System.out.println(s); . My mistake was thinking that the code wouldn’t compile because it tried to concatenate two non-String variables together. But I forgot that Java will automatically convert non-String variables in a String variable, which is why the code will actually compile and print the correct statement. So the correct answer is actually D. . Question 42 . public static void mystery(List&lt;Integer&gt; nums) { for (int k = 0; k &lt; nums.size(); k++) { if (nums.get(k).intValue() == 0) { nums.remove(k); } } } nums = [0, 0, 4, 2, 5, 0, 3, 0]; . My mistake was thinking that the boolean condition was static and that it wouldn’t change as numbers were removed from the list. I realized that certain numbers would be skipped, but I thought it wouldn’t matter if the code wouldn’t compile in the first place. So the correct answer is actually D. . 66 Question Test . Score 61/66 . This test was pretty much the same as the 52 Question test, but I was more used to the more endurance-based style after having taken the other one. I actually finished this one in 74 minutes, faster than the previous one, but I made a bit more mistakes this time (5). Looking at these mistakes, I think I need to be more careful with reading the questions because I made a lot of silly mistakes that I would’ve noticed if I just read more carefully. . Question 1 . public static void addOneToEverything(int[] numbers) { for (int j = 0; j &lt; numbers.length; j++) { numbers[j]++; } } // 1 for (int num : numbers) { num++; } // 2 for (int num : numbers) { num[j]++; } // 3 for (int num : numbers) { numbers[num]++; } . I thought that the first implementation would return the same result, but I didn’t realize that num is only assigned a copy of the value in numbers, and so the corresponding value in numbers doesn’t actually change when being incremented. So the correct answer is actually E (none of them work). . Question 7 . public class A { private int al; public void methodA() { methodB(); // Statement I } } public class B extends A { public void methodB() { methodA(); // Statement II al = 0; // Statement III } } . I noticed that Statement I wouldn’t work because a parent class can’t call a method from a child class, but I didn’t realize that Statement III wouldn’t work either because a child class can’t access a private variable in a parent class (it can access a protected variable though). So the correct answer is actually D (I and III are incorrect). . Question 38 . public String inRangeMessage(int value) { if (value &lt; 0 || value &gt; 100) return &quot;Not in range&quot;; else return &quot;In range&quot;; } // 1 if (value &lt; 0) { if (value &gt; 100) return &quot;Not in range&quot;; else return &quot;In range&quot;; } else return &quot;In range&quot;; // 2 if (value &lt; 0) return &quot;Not in range&quot;; else if (value &gt; 100) return &quot;Not in range&quot;; else return &quot;In range&quot;; // 3 if (value &gt;= 0) return &quot;In range&quot;; else if (value &lt;= 100) return &quot;In range&quot;; else return &quot;Not in range&quot;; . I thought that both 2 and 3 would work, but in actuality 3 doesn’t work. This is because the code in 3 would allow a larger range of values as answers as long as the value was positive, so something like value = 1000 would work just by fulfilling the first condition. So the correct answer is actually B (II only). . Question 43 . // 1 for (int j = 0; j &lt; arr.length; j++) { sum[j] = sum[j - 1] + arr[j]; } // 2 for (int j = 0; j &lt; arr.length; j++) { for (int k = 0; k &lt;= j; k++) { sum[j] = sum[j] + arr[k]; } } . I incorrectly thought that the first implementation of the sum would work because Java could access indexes of -1 like Python would (accessing the last value in a list), but Java doesn’t actually work like that and would instead return an error. So the correct answer is actually D (2 works, 1 doesn’t). . Question 52 . public class Toy { private String name; private double price; public Toy(String n, double p) { name = n; price = p; } public void raisePrice(double surcharge) // Line 12 { return price + surcharge; // Line 14 } } . I thought replace the void in line 12 with double would fix the compilation error, which it would, but I didn’t realize that it wouldn’t actually do what it’s supposed to. Since the method is supposed to raise the price, line 14 should actually be replaced with price += surcharge. So the correct answer is actually B. .",

Conclusion . This panel helped me learn that actually making ideas into reality within the tech industry require massive amounts of work and different components for each individual company. Everyone has their own, unique part to play: some people will be directly coding while others will be managing those people. The sheer amount of work put into these kinds of projects has also made me realize how important the tech industry is to our world today: without their hard work to improve society we wouldn’t be living lives as nice as ours currently. It’s easy to think that anyone could just write a lot of code on their own and turn their idea into something tangible that will help others, but that just isn’t realistic. I think our CSA class lets us work in a much more realistic environment. Instead of programming everything ourselves on smaller, less useful projects that don’t do much, we have tables that can program together to make a bigger, useful project that can benefit us. It actually sets us up for the real world of computer science. .",

ArrayLists are only 2.5%-7.5% but have many concepts from other units and are a good data structure to know. Also, the 3rd question of the FRQ is based on ArrayLists . 7.1 Introduction to ArrayList . Arrays ArrayLists . Static (fixed size) | Dynamic (can change size) | . Fundamental java feature | Part of a framework. Someone was nice and designed this with the behind the scenes being arrays | . An object with no methods | A class with many methods | . Not as flexible | Designed to be more flexible | . Can store more primitive data | Not designed to store primitives, they store object references | . | Slightly slower than Arrays | . | Can only be used with an import statement | . Real Life Array Example: You always have to have five players on the court . Real Life ArrayList Example: In dodgeball, the number of people in the game is changing based on who comes in or gets out . Primitive Data Types: . boolean | char | double | int | .

Often times we need to locate data inside linear structures. Normally we would use for loops in order to specify each element, one at a time, and do not need to track the index after execution. | . for ( int index = 0; index &lt; items.size(); index++ ){ //forward searching if ( items.get(index) == num ){ return index; } } . Important Things to Keep in Mind . When looking at int values, the == operator should be used. | When searching for a double value, we need to make sure the value is close enough by doing some math. | Object instances should always use the .equals(otherThing) method to check for a match. | . When searching a linear structure we need to send it the structure and what we are looking for as parameters. A standard for loop with an if block is all we need to search any linear structure. . public int whereIsMyNumber(int magicNumber, int [] myNumbers) { for (int index = 0; index &lt; myNumbers.length; index++) //search through every single spot { if (myNumbers[index] == magicNumber) //do they match? if so return index { return index; } } return -1; // if searched through every single spot, indicate its not there } . You shouldn&#39;t use the == operator when looking for an object. It will only return true if the variable and the element stored at the index point to the same memory, are aliases of each other. | . Here is an example of how you would search for a traditional object: . public int findTheWord(String searchedPhrase, ArrayList&lt;Book&gt; myBooks) { for (int index = 0; index &lt; myBooks.size(); index++) //search through every book in structure { Book currentBook = myBooks.get(index); //hold current book with current book variable String currentPhrase = currentBook.getDescription(); //get description of current book and store in variable currentPhrase if (currentPhrase.equals(searchedPhrase)) //if parameter = current phrase of book looking at - using .equals instead of == operator { return index; } } return -1; //if no match found, indicate its not there } . 7.6 Sorting . Selection sort identifies either the maximum or minimum of the compared values and iterates over the structure checking if the item stored at the index matches the condition, if so, it will swap the value stored at the index and continue. | The insertion sort is characterized by building a sorted structure as it proceeds. It inserts each value it finds at the appropriate location in the data structure. This is often accomplished by using a while loop as the inner loop. | . for (int outer = 1; outer &lt; randomList.size(); outer++) { DebugDuck tested = randomList.get(outer); //extract out a value out of list, passes to outer int inner = outer - 1; //goes back and compares to previous while ( inner &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; tested.compareTo(randomList.get(inner)) &lt; 0 ) //checks to see if index is valid { randomList.set(inner + 1, randomList.get(inner)); //move up by one and replace original location inner--; } randomList.set(inner + 1, tested); //anything taken out would be placed back into structure } . 7.7 Ethical Issues Around Data Collection . Safety with Data Collection . It is very important to minimize user data collection in our programs. While collecting data in a smaller program may not be a big issue, establishing good practices with data security is always a safer bet when eventually moving to larger projects that manage data. . Whenever you come across data that you no longer will need, it is a good practice to explicitly remove that data altogether. . import java.util.Scanner; import java.util.Arrays; public class dataRemoval { public static void main(String[] args) { // just a scanner object Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in); // makes an arraylist with some users already in it ArrayList&lt;String&gt; userList = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(Arrays.asList(&quot;Kian&quot;, &quot;Kiannp44@gmail.com&quot;, &quot;Samuel&quot;, &quot;samuelwaang@gmail.com&quot;, &quot;Calissa&quot;, &quot;calissaT@gmail.com&quot;)); // takes user&#39;s name System.out.println(&quot;Log in &quot;); System.out.println(&quot;Please enter your name:&quot;); String name = sc.nextLine(); System.out.println(name); userList.add(name); // takes user&#39;s email System.out.println(&quot;Please enter your email:&quot;); String email = sc.nextLine(); System.out.println(email); userList.add(email); // prints all the current users in arraylist System.out.println(); System.out.println(&quot;Current users in databse &quot;); System.out.println(userList); // prompt to log out System.out.println(); System.out.println(&quot;Would you like to log out? (y/n)&quot;); String logOut = sc.nextLine(); if (logOut.equals(&quot;y&quot;)) { // if user logs out, remove their name and email from arraylist System.out.println(logOut); userList.remove(name); userList.remove(email); } // reprints current users in arraylist System.out.println(); System.out.println(&quot;Current users in database &quot;); System.out.println(userList); } } dataRemoval.main(null); . Log in Please enter your name: Evan Please enter your email: evanjoelsanchez@gmail.com Current users in databse [Kian, Kiannp44@gmail.com, Samuel, samuelwaang@gmail.com, Calissa, calissaT@gmail.com, Evan, evanjoelsanchez@gmail.com] Would you like to log out? (y/n) y Current users in database [Kian, Kiannp44@gmail.com, Samuel, samuelwaang@gmail.com, Calissa, calissaT@gmail.com] . Anonymizing Personal Data . Instead of using names for users, we can use hash codes instead, which means that each user will simply be identified by their hash code. . public class hashUsers { public static void main(String[] args) { Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in); String name = sc.nextLine(); // this .hashCode() method will convert the name to a code which cannot be traced back to that original name int id = name.hashCode(); name = null; // name is now null, and nobody will ever know the original name I put in System.out.println(&quot;Hash Code: &quot; + id); } } hashUsers.main(null); . Hash Code: 2172094 . The Takeaway . It is important to understand that as a programmer handling user data, it is your responsibility to protect that collected data. The less data you collect, the less you have to safeguard. A compromised database will generally be an expensive lawsuit in a large scale project. . Homework . Quizizz . . &lt;/div&gt; | .",

            "title": "The Euclidean Algorithm",
            "content": "Underlying Properties . I shamelessly pulled everything from this article . The Euclidean Algorithm takes advantages of two properties: . GCD(A, 0) = A, GCD(0, B) = B | Given that A = B * Q + R (B != 0, Q is an integer), then GCD(A, B) = GCD(B, R) | . Explaining the first property is pretty simple. Since A is obviously the greatest divisor of itself, and 0 can divide any number, therefore GCD(A, 0) = A (and similarly for B). . Explaining the second property is more complicated. Suppose A - B = C. . First prove that GCD(A, B) evenly divides C. . A = X * GCD(A, B) . B = Y * GCD(A, B) . A - B = C . X GCD(A, B) - Y GCD(A, B) = C . (X - Y) * GCD(A, B) = C . Therefore GCD(A, B) evenly divides C. . Next, prove that GCD(B, C) evenly divides A. . A - B = C . B + C = A . M GCD(B, C) + N GCD(B, C) = A . (M + N) * GCD(B, C) = A . Therefore GCD(B, C) evenly divides A. . Next, prove that GCD(A, B) = GCD(A, A - B) . GCD(A, B) is given to evenly divide B. GCD(A, B) is proven to evenly divide C. Therefore, GCD(A, B) is a common divisor of B and C. . GCD(A, B) &lt;= GCD(B, C) because GCD(B, C) is the greatest common divisor of B and C. . GCD(B, C) is given to divide B. GCD(B, C) is proven to divide A. Therefore, GCD(B, C) is a common divisor of A and B. . GCD(B, C) &lt;= GCD(A, B) because GCD(A, B) is the greatest common divisor of A and B. . Since GCD(A, B) &lt;= GCD(B, C) and GCD(B, C) &lt;= GCD(A, B), . Therefore, GCD(A, B) = GCD(B, C). . A - B = C . GCD(A, B) = GCD(B, C) . GCD(A, B) = GCD(B, A - B) . Therefore, GCD(A, B) = GCD(B, A - B). . Summed up in this image: . Finally, prove GCD(A, B) = GCD(B, R). . GCD(A, B) = GCD(B, A - B) . GCD(A, B) = GCD(A - B, B) (The order of the terms doesn&#39;t matter) . GCD(A, B) = GCD(A - B, B) = GCD(A - 2B, B) = GCD(A - 3B, B) = ... = GCD(A - Q * B, B) (Repeated application of property) . A = Q * B + R . R = A - Q * B . GCD(A, B) = GCD(R, B) . GCD (A, B) = GCD(B, R) (The order of the terms doesn&#39;t matter) . Example . Say you want to find the GCD of 147 and 91. . GCD(147, 91) = GCD(91, 147 % 91), and this can be applied multiple times over . 147 % 91 = 56 . GCD(91, 56) = GCD(56, 91 % 56) . 91 % 56 = 35 . GCD(56, 35) = GCD(35, 56 % 35) . 56 % 35 = 21 . GCD(35, 21) = GCD(21, 35 % 21) . 35 % 21 = 14 . GCD(21, 14) = GCD(14, 21 % 14) . 21 % 14 = 7 . GCD(14, 7) = GCD(7, 14 % 7) . 14 % 7 = 0 . GCD(7, 0) = 7 . Therefore, the GCD of 147 and 91 is 7. . As you can see, repeatedly abusing the second property breaks down the huge number until reaching GCD(A, 0) or GCD(0, B), which easily simplifies to A or B respectively. . Implementation . Though the exact explanation is complicated, implementing it happens to be a lot more fun (and simple). I decided to utilize a recursory function to achieve this, taking the remainder over and over again until reaching 0, which would then return the GCD all the way back up. . public class EuclideanAlgorithm { public static int gcd(int a, int b) { if (b == 0) { // Final case of GCD(A, 0) = A return a; } else { return gcd(b, a % b); // Simplify the equation down } } public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println(gcd(294, 182)); // Test case } } EuclideanAlgorithm.main(null); . 14 . What&#39;s the Point? . Basically this is useful for taking the modulus of super large numbers (combined with other modulus properties), which is utilized heavily in cryptography. It&#39;s also useful for determining if two numbers are coprime to one another, which can be used in more number theory related math. I might delve more into the math behind cryptography in the future, but stuff like this is good for now. .",

            "title": "Test Corrections",
            "content": "The AP Collegeboard Test . For our final for APCSA trimester one, we had to take a test on college board on crucial concepts in Java. I got 33/40, which still gets me 100% in the class, but these are the corrections for the 7 questions I missed. . Question 22 . . I got this question wrong because I thought that you had to specify a method would be overriden when creating a new function in the child class with the same method signature as a function in the parent class. However, this was wrong. That’s why D is wrong. . My other mistake was that I didn’t realize that, since books only takes in a list of the object Book, using a child class AudioBook to create an object in the list is valid, but it’ll only be considered as a Book and will be unable to access methods unique to its child class. That’s why the correct answer is B, because books[0] can’t access methods that are in the child class. . Question 28 . . I’m not exactly sure why I got this wrong, but I think it’s because I thought the loop would always run, therefore x would never be equal 1 after the loop, which is false, because n can be given a value less than 2. That’s why B is wrong. . E is right because the conditions for the loop to run necessitates that n is greater than 2, therefore it’ll always be greater than 2 inside the loop. . Question 34 . . I don’t know why I got this question wrong. I realized that I wouldn’t work because it never sets the center point and III wouldn’t work because the Circle class can’t access private attributes, but I still chose the wrong answer. I think I just misclicked. . Question 35 . . I got this question wrong because I forgot to consider result * 10 in the reassignment of result. I thought that the program simply summed up the digits in the number, which is why I chose 18. But result * 10 actually means that the digits in the number are being switched around, which is why 4752 is the right answer. . Question 38 . . I got this question wrong because I forgot to consider that y being greater than 10000 is not necessary for the expression to evaluate to be true. My response does evaluate to true if y &gt; 10000, but I forgot that the other conditions of x &lt; 1500 and x &gt; 1000 can also be true to make the expression evaluate to be true. . Option A does consider both of these options, which is why it’s the correct answer. . Question 39 . . This question was really hard for me. The double recursion made things super confusing for me, until I realized that the loop of recursion would continue until n was less than or equal to 10. I thought that the answer must be less than 10, which is why I chose 8, but I forgot to realize it would multiple it by 2 one last time before returning n, which is why 16 is actually the right answer. . Question 40 . . I didn’t realize that the program would print temp instead of the original string, which is why I thought it would still print “WATCH” at the end and not just “WATC”. That’s why Option C is the right answer and not Option D. .",

            "title": "Array Lesson - Team 5",
            "content": "Arrays Overview . Arrays are 10-15% of the AP CSA Exam | The four main topics that College Board wants you to know Array creation and access | Traversing arrays | Enhanced for loops for arrays | Developing algorithms using arrays | . | The overall purpose of arrays is to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value. | . 6.1 Array Creation and Access . Arrays are used to store one data type | Unlike Arraylists, arrays have a fixed size and cannot be changed | Arrays can be denoted using braces {} Below is an example of a simple array storing our scrum team names [Meena, Shraddha, Madhumita, Pranavi] . | To use an array you have to use the command import java.util.Arrays; . | . Making Arrays . There are two ways to make arrays . using constructors | using pre-intiliazed arrays | . dataType[] arrayName = new dataType[numberOfItems]; //Constructor int[] arraySample = {1,3,5,7,9}; //pre-initialized arrays . Accessing Elements in Arrays . You can access the elements in an array using different commands | . arrayName.Length //determine the size arrayName.length - 1 //to access the last item in the array . Hack 1 . How do we access the even numbers in arrayOne from above? . int[] arrayOne = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}; for (int i = 0; i &lt; arrayOne.length; i++) { if ((i + 1) % 2 == 0) { System.out.println(arrayOne[i]); } } . 3 7 . Hack 2 . Which of the following is FALSE about arrays . A. A java array is an object | B. Length of array can be changed after creation of array | C. Numerical data types of arrays are initialized to 0 to start | . B is FALSE . 6.2 Traversing Arrays . Traversing is accessing every value in the array | Can be done using a loop like a for loop or while loop | Below is an example - using a for loop, we can iterate through each fruit in the array of Strings and print it out | . // Here is the array we will be working with String[] myFruits = new String[] {&quot;Apple&quot;, &quot;Strawberry&quot;, &quot;Watermelon&quot;, &quot;Blueberry&quot;}; for (int i = 0; i &lt; myFruits.length; i++) { System.out.println(&quot;Fruit number &quot; + i + &quot; is &quot; + myFruits[i]); } . Can also loop through an array in reverse | . for (int i = myFruits.length - 1; i &gt;= 0 ; i--) { System.out.println(&quot;Fruit number &quot; + i + &quot; is &quot; + myFruits[i]); } . If we have a list of numbers, we could change each value in the array by a certain amount | . // Here is the array we will be working with int[] myNumbers = new int[] {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}; for (int i = 0; i &lt; myNumbers.length; i++) { // add 10 to each element in the array myNumbers[i] += 10; System.out.println(&quot;New element &quot; + i + &quot; is &quot; + myNumbers[i]); } . We can also traverse an array using a while loop | . // Here is the array we will be working with String[] myFruits = new String[] {&quot;Apple&quot;, &quot;Strawberry&quot;, &quot;Watermelon&quot;, &quot;Blueberry&quot;}; int i = 0; while (i &lt; myFruits.length) { System.out.println(&quot;Fruit number &quot; + i + &quot; is &quot; + myFruits[i]); i++; } . Bound Errors . ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException thrown, can happen when using loops to access array elements | In the example below instead of the condition being while the index is less than the length of the array, the condition is less than or equal too | This mean the loop will try to run when i = 4 (since the length of the list is 4). However since array index starts from 0, the last item in the array will have an index of 3. So, index of 4 will be out of bounds, resulting in the error. | . int i = 0; while (i &lt;= myFruits.length) { System.out.println(&quot;Fruit number &quot; + i + &quot; is &quot; + myFruits[i]); i++; } . Hack 3 . Create a function that takes in a list of integers and returns the list with the integers in ascending order. Print every element in this list | Example int[] myNumbers = new int[] {5, 3, 4, 1, 2}; | arraySorter(myNumbers); | Expected Output 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | . | . | . public class AL { public static void ascending(int[] array) { Arrays.sort(array); for (int number : array) { System.out.println(number); } } public static void main(String[] args) { int[] myNumbers = new int[] {5, 3, 4, 1, 2}; ascending(myNumbers); } } AL.main(null); . | a type with the same simple name is already defined by the static single-type-import of Arrays | Arrays.sort(array); reference to Arrays is ambiguous both class Arrays in and class java.util.Arrays in java.util match . Hack 4 . Given the following code segment, which of the following will cause an infinite loop? Assume that temp is an int variable initialized to be greater than zero and that a is an array of integers. | . for ( int k = 0; k &lt; a.length; k++ ) { while ( a[ k ] &lt; temp ) { a[ k ] *= 2; } } . A. The values don&#39;t matter this will always cause an infinite loop. | B. Whenever a includes a value that is less than or equal to zero. | C. Whenever a has values larger then temp. | D. When all values in a are larger than temp. | E. Whenever a includes a value equal to temp. | . 6.3 Enhanced for loop for Arrays . This topic was pretty short, but essentially what you need to know is about the enhanced for loop. The enhanced for loop can be used to traverse through most data structures (i.g. arrays). However, it can only traverse in a forward direction. Usually the structure is like so . for (dataType i: arrayName) { do something with i } . Essentially, this code mentions how every element in the array (i) has to have something done to it. It&#39;s important to note that although there is access to the element i, but it isn&#39;t possible to change the value/set new values to element i. . We can use mutator methods on objects on the array to set the value of their instance variables. This is because i is a copy of the object reference, which means that i refers to the same object as the array element, so calling methods on i is the same as calling methods on the individual array elements themselves. For example . public class Student { private String name; /** Sets the name of the Student */ public void setName(String name) { this.name = name; } /** Other instance variables, methods, and constructors not shown */ } // IN ANOTHER CLASS /** Resets all students&#39; names */ public static void doubleArray(Student[] array, String defaultName) { for (Student student: array) { student.setName(defaultName); // Sets each student&#39;s name to a default name } } . Hack 5 . In this example, each loop includes an int array and a String array. Try adding another high score and another name to the arrays and se if you can get it to run. . public class ForEachDemo { public static void main(String[] args) { int[] highScores = { 10, 9, 8, 8, 11}; String[] names = {&quot;Jamal&quot;, &quot;Emily&quot;, &quot;Destiny&quot;, &quot;Mateo&quot;, &quot;Bailey&quot;}; // for each loop with an int array for (int value : highScores) { System.out.println( value ); } // for each loop with a String array for (String value : names) { System.out.println(value); // this time it&#39;s a name! } } } ForEachDemo.main(null); . 10 9 8 8 11 Jamal Emily Destiny Mateo Bailey . Hack 6 . What code would you add to the following to output the length of each String that&#39;s returned from the below method? Choose A, B, C, or D. . 6.4 Developing Algorithms using Arrays . Here are some algorithms that arrays can be used for (from college board standards), . Minimum and Maximum of a list of elements | Compute the sum, average, or mode of multiple elements | Determine if at least one element has a property | Access consecutive pairs of elements | Determine duplicates | . What to use when problem solving with arrays .length can be used to find the length of an array . The value at a specific index can be found with array[i], where i is the index | An element at index i can be replaced using array[i] = new element | You can iterate over an array with a for loop for(type element: array) { code here . | . Computing Sums with Arrays . See the code below for a sample algorithm of how to compute the sum of elements in an array. This could be applied to finding the mean, standard deviation, or any other algorithm that requires summation. . int[] array = {5, 1, 78}; // intialize int sum = 0; // variable to keep track of sum for (int number : array) { // iterates over each loop in the array sum += number; // the number is added to the sum } System.out.println(sum); //expected sum is 84, so 84 should be printed . 84 . Find the max . // from college board private double findMax(double[] values) { double max = values[0]; // initialize max with first element of array for(int i=1; i&lt;values.length; i++) { // starting with the second element, iterate over the rest of the array if (values[i] &gt; max) { // if the current element is greater than the max max = values[i]; // set the max equal to the greatest value until that point } } return max; } . Find the amount of even numbers. . private int findEvenNumbers(int[] values) { int evenCount = 0; // initalize count of even numbers to zero for(int value: values) { // iterate over every element of array if(value % 2 == 0) { // use modulus operator to check if value is even evenCount += 1; // increment evenCount if the value is even } } return evenCount; } . Hack 7 . Return a left-shifted array . Ex . {7,9,4} --&gt; {9,4,7} | {1,2,3} --&gt; {2,3,1} | {0,9} --&gt; {9,0} | {1} --&gt; {1} | . Hack 8 . Find the number of duplicate elements in an array. . Hack 9 . Use arrays to reverse a string. . Ex . &quot;hello &quot; --&gt; &quot;olleh &quot; | &quot;slay &quot; --&gt; &quot;yals &quot; | &quot;mom &quot; --&gt; &quot;mom &quot; | . Homework . Finish the FRQ part a for homework. This free response question deals with arrays. . public void addMembers(String[] names, int gradYear) { for (String name : names) { memberList.add(new MemberInfo(name, gradYear, true)); } } .",

StepTracker, object w/ parameter that defines min steps to be active . methods: . addDailySteps, once per day | activeDays | averageSteps, returns avg num steps per day (total steps/number of days) | .

If there is 0 days, return 0 cuz thats what it says in the q . otherwise return steps/days to get average steps . Extra Notes . Class Creation . All classes should be capitalized to distinguish them from primitive datatypes (naming conventions). Constructors are necessary for each class in order for them to initialize their internal attributes, though they&#39;re special in that they do not require a return type because the object is being created in its stead. . Accessors and Mutators . Accessor methods (called getters) allow code outside of the class to access private variables. They&#39;re public methods that return private attributes, allowing the class to control access to its private attributes. . Mutator methods (called setters) allow code outside of the class to change private variables. They&#39;re public methods that take in a parameter (the new value) and return nothing, allowing the class to control outside code changing its private attributes. . Static variables and methods . Static variables (also known as class variables) are variables that are shared by the entire class, meaning that it will be the same for every instance of an object. It&#39;s useful for when certain attributes need to be standardized for an entire class (i.e. any object of a quadrilateral class must have the number of sides set equal to 4). . Static methods (also known as class methods) are methods that can be called using the class itself (along with objects of the class). Essentially, they make it easy for outside code to call certain methods specific to a class without having to instantiate a new object every single time, which can be seen in common imported Java classes such as Math. . Access modifiers . This . The keyword &quot;this&quot; inside classes means that the object will reference itself as the called object, meaning that the class can make self references even before having any objects created. The most common usage of this can be seen inside of constructors, where attributes are self-referenced to instantiate values. . Main method vs. Tester methods . The Main method is the method which starts the entire program along will all of its associated files. This is what actually starts the program and all of its components. Tester methods are usually public static void main(String[] args) methods inside of all the other classes in order to test that certain features inside of each class are working. As such, they are not called when the main method is run and only serves to make sure everything works. . public class Rhombus { private static int sides = 4; private String name; private double[] angles; public Rhombus(String name, double[] angles) { this.name = name; this.angles = angles; } public String getName() { return this.name; } public void setName(String name) { this.name = name; } public static int getSides() { return sides; } public static void main(String[] args) { Rhombus timmy = new Rhombus(&quot;Tim&quot;, new double[]{90, 90, 90, 90}); } } Rhombus.main(null); .",

They&#39;re useful for evaluating basic boolean expressions as well as more complicated compound boolean expressions, which use multiple kinds of boolean operators inside each other. . De Morgan&#39;s Law . De Morgan&#39;s Law is a bit more mathematical in nature, dealing with set theory, so I&#39;ll try my best to describe it here. . De Morgan&#39;s Law basically explains how certain boolean statements can be rewritten as different expressions, yet essentially be the same. More specifically, it states that &quot;The complement of the union of two sets is the same as the intersection of their complements&quot; or &quot;The complement of the intersection of two sets is the same as the union of their complements&quot;. . What the heck does that mean? An easier way to think about it would be like this: . not (A or B) = (not A) and (not B) | not (A and B) = (not A) or (not B) | . In a more formalalized, mathematical way: . . But even with all that text, it&#39;s still pretty confusing, right? So it&#39;s probably best to visualize it using an actual image. This one I found online pretty much summarizes it best: . . The green shaded area is basically what&#39;s being covered in each equality. Both sides cover the same thing. . Finally, let&#39;s go through an example of how this would apply in code. Essentially, we&#39;ll use a few variables to make a whole bunch of complicated compounded boolean expressions that actually mean the same exact thing: . public class deMorgansLaw { public static void main(String[] args) { boolean a = false; boolean b = true; // These two statements are exactly equal according to De Morgan&#39;s law // In this case, the only way to yield an output of true would be to have both a and b to be false (change it to check) System.out.println(!(a || b)); System.out.println(!a &amp;&amp; !b); boolean c = true; boolean d = false; // These two statements are also exactly equal according to De Morgan&#39;s Law // In this case, the only way to yield an output of false would be to have both c and d to be true (change it to check) System.out.println(!(c &amp;&amp; d)); System.out.println(!c || !d); } } deMorgansLaw.main(null); . false false true true . Comparison of Various Datatypes . Numbers . Numbers such as integers, doubles, and floats can be compared using operators found in basic math such as: . == | != | &lt; | &gt; | &lt;= | &gt;= | . Strings . Strings can be compared using the String method .equals() which checks if the objects that calls and is called are equal to each other (based on the alphanumeric contents of both) . Objects . Objects can be compared with two different methods, equals() (similar to comparing Strings) and hashCode(). Without overriding any methods, equals() checks if the two objects are equal using &quot;==&quot; operator (which checks if the object references point to the same object) and hashCode() generates a unique ID for each object to check if two objects are the same. In a more practical sense, both equals() and hashCode() should be overriden to better match the specific class being used. . // Numbers System.out.println(4 &gt; 3); System.out.println(5 != 5); // Strings System.out.println(&quot;Hello World&quot;.equals(&quot;Hello World&quot;)); System.out.println(&quot;Code Code Code&quot;.equals(&quot;code code code&quot;)); // Objects public class Name { private String first; public Name(String first) { this.first = first; } } Name name1 = new Name(&quot;Bailey&quot;); Name name2 = new Name(&quot;Bailey&quot;); System.out.println(name1.equals(name2)); System.out.println(name1.hashCode() == name2.hashCode()); . true false true false false false .",

It&#39;s pretty simple to do with just the &quot;+&quot; operator between two strings (or alternatively the concat() method). Using mixed datatypes together is also pretty easy, as Java will automatically cast different datatypes into Strings when needed, making the entire process much easier. . int numOfCats = 34; String sentencep1 = &quot;I have &quot;; System.out.println(&quot;I have 34 cats!&quot;); System.out.println(&quot;I have &quot; + numOfCats + &quot; cats!&quot;); . I have 34 cats! I have 34 cats! . Math Class . The Math class is one class that is useful for many programmers, especially considering its numerous mathematical operations that are necessary in a math-heavy field like computer science. One such method is Math.random(), which can allow programmers to simulate randomness (to a certain extent) by generating a random double from 0 to just below 1, which can be edited to encompass nearly any range of numbers. . // Randomnly prints out a number from 1 to 10 System.out.println((int)(Math.random() * 10 + 1)); . 5 .",

Some of the most basic primitives include: . Booleans | Ints | Doubles | Chars | Etc. | . They have particular naming conventions (lowercase, no special characters/keywords) and can also be type casted (manually or automatically) .

Is the final in the tests category? . Extra Notes . Casting . Casting is a method of forcefully changing the data type of data, though it won&#39;t work in every instance. For instance, a String (obviously) cannot be converted into an int, but an int can be converted into a String. . There are many uses for casting. When dividing with integers, results are automatically truncuated into whole numbers, which can be annoying for many reasons. However, when the integers are casted into doubles, then the result will be a double with the correct accuracy. On the other hand, sometimes truncuated integer results are required from doubles, and the solution is to cast the result into an int. . // Division int num1 = 4; int num2 = 3; System.out.println((double)(num1) / (double)(num2)); // Truncuation/Rounding double num3 = 5.0; double num4 = 2.0; System.out.println((int)(num3 / num4)); . 1.3333333333333333 2 . Wrapper Classes . When it&#39;s more useful to turn a primitive datatype into an object (like for parsing and stuff), wrapper classes are used for each of the primitives: . Integer for int | Long for long | Float for float | Double for double | Boolean for boolean | Character for char | . Some instances where wrapper classes are required include the use of ArrayLists, which can only store objects. Therefore, all primitive datatypes stored must be converted into their wrapper class equivalents: . ArrayList&lt;Double&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;Double&gt;(); ArrayList&lt;Character&gt; list2 = new ArrayList&lt;Character&gt;(); .",

Students (especially those with 4 APs and extracurriculars) need planners to organize everything they need to do, so why not make one using Java? . I decided to go for an object-orientated design, with the creation of the object handling all of the options. An infinite while loop is used to keep iterating over the added options and the choice entry, with only the entry of &quot;-1&quot; breaking the loop and ending the planner. . There are 5 options (with 1 extra to end it), utilizing numerous methods in the ArrayList interface. Option 1 utilizes .add(), 2 utilizes .addAll(), 3 utilizes .remove() (both method signatures), 4 utilizes .clear(), and 5 utilizes .get(). .",

Runtime using Thymeleaf . Personal Hacks . For these hacks, I&#39;ll be making the red-scale, green-scale, blue-scale, and gray-scale conversions first, and then I&#39;ll fix the compression issue. .

It&#39;s annoying to have to write the same code to construct each image and get their properties, so I just decided to write that all here. . Some of the code is copied from above; I took the constructor, setStats(), and resize(). Those functions are pretty optimized already, so trying to remake them is pointless. What I do need to optimize with completelly new code is the color scaling and ASCII conversions, which will be later. . import java.awt.Color; import java.awt.image.BufferedImage; import java.awt.Image; import java.awt.Graphics2D; import java.io.File; import java.io.FileWriter; import java.io.IOException; import java.io.PrintWriter; import java.nio.file.Files; import java.nio.file.Path; import java.nio.file.Paths; import javax.imageio.stream.ImageOutputStream; import javax.imageio.stream.ImageInputStream; import javax.imageio.metadata.IIOMetadata; import javax.imageio.IIOImage; import javax.imageio.ImageIO; import javax.imageio.ImageWriteParam; import javax.imageio.ImageWriter; import javax.imageio.ImageReader; import javax.imageio.ImageTypeSpecifier; abstract class ImageBlueprint { protected final String inDir = &quot;images/&quot;; // location of images protected final String outDir = &quot;images/tmp/&quot;; // location of created files protected String inFile; protected String resizedFile; protected String colorFile; protected String ext; // extension of file protected long bytes; protected int width; protected int height; // get attributes of picture public ImageBlueprint(String name, String ext) { this.ext = ext; this.inFile = this.inDir + name + &quot;.&quot; + ext; this.resizedFile = this.outDir + name + &quot;.&quot; + ext; this.colorFile = this.outDir + name + &quot;New&quot; + &quot;.png&quot;; this.setStats(); } public ImageBlueprint(String image) { this(image, &quot;png&quot;); } // An image contains metadata, namely size, width, and height public void setStats() { BufferedImage img; try { Path path = Paths.get(this.inFile); this.bytes = Files.size(path); img = ImageIO.read(new File(this.inFile)); this.width = img.getWidth(); this.height = img.getHeight(); } catch (IOException e) { } } // Scale or reduce to &quot;scale&quot; percentage provided public void resize(int scale) { BufferedImage img = null; Image resizedImg = null; int width = (int) (this.width * (scale/100.0) + 0.5); int height = (int) (this.height * (scale/100.0) + 0.5); try { // read an image to BufferedImage for processing img = ImageIO.read(new File(this.inFile)); // set buffer of image data // create a new BufferedImage for drawing resizedImg = img.getScaledInstance(width, height, Image.SCALE_SMOOTH); } catch (IOException e) { return; } //ImageIO.write(convertToBufferedImage(resizedImg), this.ext, new File(resizedFile)); this.inFile = this.resizedFile; // use scaled file vs original file in Class this.setStats(); } // Will be used later protected abstract void conversion(); } . Seeing Red... Green... Blue... and Gray . Now that I&#39;ve written the template, it&#39;s actually pretty easy to scale everything to a certain color. . For the primary colors, all that&#39;s needed is to set the values of the non scaled color to be 00 (for example red-scaling would have green and blue be set to 00). . Gray-scaling is a bit more complicated. There are multiple methods that, in theory, should work. According to one website I found, there are two methods: average or weighted. Average is as simple as it seems - just take the average of all three values: . Grayscale = (R + G + B) / 3 . However, due to the way that humans perceive light (with different sensitivities for different colors), this isn&#39;t the most accurate. This leads to the weighted method, based on the way humans actually weigh different colors of light in their vision:&gt; Grayscale = 0.299R + 0.587G + 0.114B I got the information on grayscaling from here, so click that link to learn more about it. . Since the weighted method is more efficient, that&#39;s what I&#39;ll be using here. Actually implementing it was pretty difficult though. Instead of using the numeric RGB values, I had to calculate the luminance in order to make everything work. . public class RedConversion extends ImageBlueprint { public RedConversion(String name, String ext) { super(name, ext);

ASCII Hell . Finally, I&#39;m going to convert images to ASCII characters. The problem with the old method was that it stretched the image out too much and didn&#39;t look good at all. I found that the best solution would be to take 4 rows and 2 columns of pixels and convert them into a single ASCII character, so that&#39;s what I implemented here. . Also, as a side note, I basically just copied the previous code and edited that. No point in reinventing the wheel once you already get what&#39;s happening. . Additionally, (I didn&#39;t have to, but) I tried to fix the ASCII characters to be more evenly spaced out. I decided to use the link provided and found a chart of 94 characters organized by those that took the most dark space to those that took the least. . Now here&#39;s the fun math part. I wanted to get a mostly divisible number but 94 only factors into 47 and 2, so I rounded to 90 and decided to take 15 of those ASCII characters to use. Then, I took every 6th character in the character list to get my values. Next, I derived an equation to get the thresholds. Since the max value of RGB is 255 and the max percentage of coverage is 23.1%, I got t = (1 - 1/0.23) * 255 to find the thresholds. Finally, I compared each character and plugged its respective coverage percent into the equation to get every threshold. . As for the results, they went a bit differently than how I expected. I&#39;m not going to show them here, but they&#39;re a lot more detailed than the original ASCII calculator. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t think it looks super good with smaller images, so I decided to keep the old conversion. . public class ASCIIConversion extends ImageBlueprint { public ASCIIConversion(String name, String ext) { super(name, ext); this.colorFile = this.outDir + name + &quot;ASCII&quot; + &quot;.txt&quot;; } public ASCIIConversion(String name) { super(name); this.colorFile = this.outDir + name + &quot;ASCII&quot; + &quot;.txt&quot;; } @Override protected void conversion() { // Controls how big chunks are taken for ASCII characters final int XLENGTH = 1; final int YLENGTH = 2; BufferedImage img = null; PrintWriter asciiPrt = null; FileWriter asciiWrt = null; Color col = null; try { File file = new File(this.colorFile); Files.deleteIfExists(file.toPath()); } catch (IOException e) { System.out.println(&quot;Delete File error: &quot; + e); } try { asciiPrt = new PrintWriter(asciiWrt = new FileWriter(this.colorFile, true)); } catch (IOException e) { System.out.println(&quot;ASCII out file create error: &quot; + e); } try { img = ImageIO.read(new File(this.inFile)); } catch (IOException e) { } for (int i = 0; i &lt; img.getHeight(); i += 4) { for (int j = 0; j &lt; img.getWidth(); j += 2) { // colorSum stores total sum of RGB values, counter keeps track of how many are being counted // colorSum/counter = average // average is taken to get ASCII character double colorSum = 0; int counter = 0; for (int k = 0; k &lt; XLENGTH; k++) { for (int l = 0; l &lt; YLENGTH; l++) { if (k &lt; img.getWidth() &amp;&amp; l &lt; img.getHeight()) { counter++; col = new Color(img.getRGB(j + k, i + l)); colorSum += (((col.getRed() * 0.30) + (col.getBlue() * 0.59) + (col .getGreen() * 0.11))); } } } double average = colorSum / counter; try { asciiPrt.print(asciiChar(average)); asciiPrt.flush(); asciiWrt.flush(); } catch (Exception ex) { } } try { asciiPrt.println(&quot;&quot;); asciiPrt.flush(); asciiWrt.flush(); } catch (Exception ex) { } } } // conversion table, there may be better out there ie https://www.billmongan.com/Ursinus-CS173-Fall2020/Labs/ASCIIArt public String asciiChar(double g) { String str = &quot; &quot;; // Higher quality, looks better with bigger images // if (g &gt;= 224.6) { // str = &quot; &quot;; // } else if (g &gt;= 186.6) { // str = &quot;-&quot;; // } else if (g &gt;= 165.5) { // str = &quot;;&quot;; // } else if (g &gt;= 143) { // str = &quot;(&quot;; // } else if (g &gt;= 137.5) { // str = &quot;&lt;&quot;; // } else if (g &gt;= 127.5) { // str = &quot;L&quot;; // } else if (g &gt;= 123.1) { // str = &quot;1&quot;; // } else if (g &gt;= 113.1) { // str = &quot;n&quot;; // } else if (g &gt;= 102) { // str = &quot;s&quot;; // } else if (g &gt;= 85.4) { // str = &quot;h&quot;; // } else if (g &gt;= 75.4) { // str = &quot;4&quot;; // } else if (g &gt;= 69.8) { // str = &quot;e&quot;; // } else if (g &gt;= 62.1) { // str = &quot;5&quot;; // } else if (g &gt;= 51) { // str = &quot;D&quot;; // } else if (g &gt;= 35.5) { // str = &quot;Q&quot;; // } else if (g &gt;= 17.8) { // str = &quot;M&quot;; // } else { // str = &quot;@&quot;; // } if (g &gt;= 240) { str = &quot; &quot;; } else if (g &gt;= 210) { str = &quot;.&quot;; } else if (g &gt;= 190) { str = &quot;*&quot;; } else if (g &gt;= 170) { str = &quot;+&quot;; } else if (g &gt;= 120) { str = &quot;^&quot;; } else if (g &gt;= 110) { str = &quot;&amp;&quot;; } else if (g &gt;= 80) { str = &quot;8&quot;; } else if (g &gt;= 60) { str = &quot;#&quot;; } else { str = &quot;@&quot;; } return str; } public static void main(String[] args) { ASCIIConversion nicandrohan = new ASCIIConversion(&quot;nicandrohan&quot;, &quot;png&quot;); nicandrohan.conversion(); } } . .",

Each student in the table has a name, grade, school, role, and event list. . // define a function to hold data for a Person class Person { constructor(name, grade, school, category) { this.name = name; this.grade = grade; this.school = school; this.role = &quot;&quot;; this.category = category; } // define a setter for role in Person data setRole(role) { this.role = role; } // define a JSON conversion &quot;method&quot; associated with Person toJSON() { const obj = { name: this.name, grade: this.grade, school: this.school, role: this.role, category: this.category }; const json = JSON.stringify(obj); // json/string is useful when passing data on internet return json; } } // testing function function logItType(output) { console.log(typeof output, &quot;;&quot;, output); } // make a new Person and assign to variable teacher var instructor = new Person(&quot;Carry P&quot;, 11, &quot;Del Norte High School&quot;, [&quot;Forensics&quot;, &quot;Forestry&quot;]); // object type is easy to work with in JavaScript // output of Object and JSON/string associated with Teacher instructor.setRole(&quot;Instructor&quot;); // set the role var students = [ new Person(&quot;Hugh A&quot;, 11, &quot;Del Norte High School&quot;, [&quot;It&#39;s about Time&quot;, &quot;Anatomy&quot;]), new Person(&quot;Banana B&quot;, 11, &quot;Del Norte High School&quot;, [&quot;Fermi Questions&quot;]), new Person(&quot;Biscuit M&quot;, 11, &quot;Westview High School&quot;, [&quot;Astronomy&quot;]) ]; class SciolyRoster { constructor(instructor, students) { // set instructors instructor.setRole(&quot;Instructor&quot;); this.instructor = instructor; // set students this.students = students; // initiate the array for roster this.roster = [instructor]; // add all students to the array this.students.forEach(student =&gt; { student.setRole(&quot;Student&quot;); this.roster.push(student); }); // convert to JSON this.json = []; this.roster.forEach(person =&gt; this.json.push(person.toJSON())); } } roster2021 = new SciolyRoster(instructor, students); SciolyRoster.prototype._toHtml = function() { var style = ( &quot;display:inline-block;&quot; + &quot;border: 2px solid black;&quot; + &quot;box-shadow: 0.8em 0.4em 0.4em grey;&quot; ); var body = &quot;&quot;; // set up top row of table body += &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;Name&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;Grade&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;School&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;Role&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;Category&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;/tr&gt;&quot;; for (var row in roster2021.roster) { // tr for each row, a new line body += &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot;; // td for each column of data body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + roster2021.roster[row].name + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + roster2021.roster[row].grade + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + roster2021.roster[row].school + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + roster2021.roster[row].role + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + roster2021.roster[row].category + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; // tr to end line body += &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot;; } return ( &quot;&lt;div style=&#39;&quot; + style + &quot;&#39;&gt;&quot; + &quot;&lt;header&gt;2021 Roster&lt;/header&gt;&quot; + &quot;&lt;table&gt;&quot; + body + &quot;&lt;/table&gt;&quot; + &quot;&lt;/div&gt;&quot; ); } $$.html(roster2021._toHtml()); . 2021 Roster . NameGradeSchoolRoleCategory . Carry P | 11 | Del Norte High School | Instructor | Forensics,Forestry | Hugh A | 11 | Del Norte High School | Student | It&#39;s about Time,Anatomy | Banana B | 11 | Del Norte High School | Student | Fermi Questions | Biscuit M | 11 | Westview High School | Student | Astronomy | &lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; The Process . Writing all of this code took quite a while as more and more classes were introduced. . I started from the most basic component, a Person. I added the basic attributes like name, grade, school, role, and category. Note how the roles haven&#39;t been specified yet. Next, I created my first specific instructor, using the setRole() method to give the specific role of &quot;instructor&quot;. Instructors have special roles to play so they are distinct from students, which I made next in a list. Combining both the instructor and students, I created the SciolyRoster class which is going to be used to create the table. . The table mainly using a function _toHtml() which required manually typing in each line that would be used to create the table along with filling each row in with the data from the SciolyRoster class. At the end, it returned the html code to create the table, and when called by $$.html, it automatically converted it into a real html table. . &lt;/div&gt; . .",

Hacks . Objective of Hacks is to produce the Fibonacci sequence in multiple ways. See this runtime. The method provided is Stream, the objective is to produce more familiar methods like ...- For Loop . While Loop | Recursion The trick is to produce all these methods without reproducing the same lines of code. Try to store and capture result data from parent class. | Read the comments of the code in this Blog, as the code instructs you on what to abstract. | . In Blog or code, comment on how this assignment fulfills the following standards from College Board. . Skill 1.B:Determine code that would be used to complete code segments (ie For, While, Recursion)- Skill 4.C: Determine if two or more code segments yield equivalent results (be sure to Discuss how you know results are the same) | Skill 5.A: Describe the behavior of a given segment of program code (describe the difference in recursion versus for &amp; while loops, perhaps add timing to determine speed) | . Personal Hacks: Lesson 5 . The previous algorithm already showed how to make the Fibonacci sequence using a Stream algorithm. However, there are numerous other ways to make the fibonacci sequence, whether it be through for-loops, while-loops, or recursion. . To avoid rewriting code, I put all of my hacks in the previous code cell, so I could access the attributes and methods already created in Fibo, making everything a lot easier to implement. Things like the hashmap along with the setData() function made everything a lot simpler. . Note that I did edit the print section to output the execution time, but I&#39;ll get into why I did that in this next section. . College Board Standards . Skill 1.B: For this particular problem, I created three different implementations (alongside the premade one). Using for-loops and while-loops had pretty similar implementations. Both had a line at the top that handled the iteration, and in the case of the while-loop, I just needed to increment the counter at the bottom (whereas the for-loop was automatic). For Recursion, I had to call a function over and over again with a counter that incremented with each call of the function to make sure the sequence stopped at the right number. | Skill 4.C: The Stream, For-loop, While-loop, and Recursion implementations of the Fibonacci sequence all yield the same results. I can tell this by comparing the printed results from each method - all of them are exactly the same (save for the names of the init method used). | Skill 5.A: For the most part, it appears that, For-loop, While-loop, and Recursion implementations take roughly the same amount of time, hovering around ~13500 nanoseconds of execution time. However, the Stream method seems to take significantly more amounts of time, spending 324375 nanoseconds, which is about 24 times longer than the previous implementations mentioned. In order to find these numbers, I used System.nanoTime(), which basically returns the System time in nanoseconds. Simply subtracting the difference between the start and end implementation allowed me to determine how long it took for each method to run. | .",

            "title": "FRQ 1 Practice",
            "content": "The First FRQ . The first FRQ primarily focuses around methods and control structures, which isn&#39;t too bad as far as I&#39;m concerned. Methods are about the specific functions an object can perform, whereas control structures are mainly about the if, elseif, and else statemements that can branch a program out into different pathways. These are quite fundamental concepts for the Java language, so I think I know them pretty well already. . However, it&#39;s never a good idea to underestimate the difficulty of these questions, as these can easily make or break a 5 on the exam. That&#39;s why I&#39;ll be practicing them today in this blog. . 2021 . This FRQ is really annoying to put in, so I&#39;ll just link it here . The code block below has my work for both part a and b, with an additional main() function to test solutions (which is not there on the exam unfortunately). . public class WordMatch { /** The secret string. */ private String secret; /** Constructs a WordMatch object with the given secret string of lowercase letters. */ public WordMatch(String word) { /* implementation not shown */ this.secret = word; } /** Returns a score for guess, as described in part (a). * Precondition: 0 &lt; guess.length() &lt;= secret.length() */ // START OF SOLUTION A public int scoreGuess(String guess) { // Tracks number of times the substring appears int occurrences = 0; // secret.length() - guess.length() to avoid index overflow with substring later on for (int i = 0; i &lt;= secret.length() - guess.length(); i++) { // Checks if the substring is equal to the guess if (secret.substring(i, i + guess.length()).contains(guess)) { occurrences++; // Moves forward by guess.length() - 1 to move forward in the string (and avoid repeats) // -1 is included because i++ i += guess.length() - 1; } } return occurrences * guess.length() * guess.length(); } // END OF SOLUTION A // START OF SOLUTION B public String findBetterGuess(String guess1, String guess2) { /* to be implemented in part (b) */ if (scoreGuess(guess1) &gt; scoreGuess(guess2)) { return guess1; } else if (scoreGuess(guess2) &gt; scoreGuess(guess1)) { return guess2; } else if (guess1.compareTo(guess2) &gt; 0) { return guess1; } else { return guess2; } } // END OF SOLUTION B public static void main(String[] args) { WordMatch testA = new WordMatch(&quot;mississippi&quot;); System.out.println(testA.scoreGuess(&quot;issippi&quot;)); System.out.println(testA.scoreGuess(&quot;mississippi&quot;)); WordMatch testB = new WordMatch(&quot;concatenation&quot;); System.out.println(testB.findBetterGuess(&quot;ten&quot; , &quot;nation&quot;)); System.out.println(testB.findBetterGuess(&quot;con&quot;, &quot;cat&quot;)); } } WordMatch.main(null); . 49 121 nation con . The Process . For the first time solving an FRQ, I don&#39;t think it was too bad (although we had a pretty big handicap with being able to test solutions). . The first part wasn&#39;t too hard; the iteration was a bit different but we eventually came upon a solution to our problems. Troubleshooting it was probably the hardest part though. Finding the subtle mistakes that we made in the process was painful, even with the ability to compile. . The second part was pretty easy aside from one part. It was easy enough to compare the two values using the previous scoreGuess() function, but we didn&#39;t know how to compare alphabetically. We were completely stuck and I was even considering using a for loop to iterate through each letter, but eventually I realized that the compareTo() method existed for Strings, and that basically solved the problem. . After completing it, Rohan and I eventually made a more simplified version on Rohan&#39;s version of the blog, especially improving part A. We found part A to be the hardest part of the entire ordeal, so we got to work to find a better solution. Eventually we simplified it down a few lines, so I think we definitely improved on making those kinds of solutions. . Overall, I think we did a decent job. Obviously it isn&#39;t good enough for the AP Exam, but I think we can definitely get the hang of creating solutions like these pretty quickly in the future. .",

Object Orientated Hell . For my final trick, I shall (try) to make an object orientated version of the monkey story. Except it&#39;s not monkeys this time, but dinosaurs getting killed by meteorites. Made (mostly) from scratch, this version will involve creating individual objects, each with a list of strings making up a dino. . import java.util.ArrayList; public class Dinos { // Stores all the dinos private static ArrayList&lt;String[]&gt; dinoList = new ArrayList&lt;String[]&gt;(); // Stores individual dino for each object private String[] dino; public Dinos(String[] dino) { this.dino = dino; dinoList.add(dino); } // Prints poem public static void printPoem() { int dinoCount = dinoList.size(); for (int i = dinoCount; i &gt; 0; i--) { System.out.println(i + &quot; dinos strolling around&quot;); for (int col = 0; col &lt; dinoList.get(0).length; col++) { for (int row = 0; row &lt; i; row++) { System.out.print(dinoList.get(row)[col] + &quot; t&quot;); } System.out.println(); } if (i &gt; 1) { System.out.println(&quot;A meteor came down and bumped a head&quot;); System.out.println(&quot;Uh Oh!&quot;); System.out.println(&quot;Now one is dead!&quot;); System.out.println(); } else { System.out.println(&quot;A meteor came down and bumped a head&quot;); System.out.println(&quot;Uh Oh!&quot;); System.out.println(&quot;Now all are dead!&quot;); System.out.println(); } } } // Prints individual dino of specific object public void printDino() { for (String bodyPart : this.dino) { System.out.println(bodyPart); } } // Two methods to get rid of monkey - by default gets rid of last one, with argument it removes at specified index public static void removeDino() { dinoList.remove(dinoList.size() - 1); } public static void removeDino(int i) { dinoList.remove(i); } public static void main(String[] args) { Dinos dino0 = new Dinos(new String[]{ &quot; __ &quot;, &quot; / _)&quot;, &quot; _/ / / _/ /&quot;, &quot; _| / &quot;, &quot; _| ( | ( | &quot;, &quot; /__.-&#39;|_|--|_| &quot;, &quot; Jimmy &quot; }); Dinos dino1 = new Dinos(new String[]{ &quot; __ &quot;, &quot; / _)&quot;, &quot; _.-._/ / &quot;, &quot; _| / &quot;, &quot; _| ( | ( | &quot;, &quot; /__.-&#39;|_|--|_| &quot;, &quot; Jeremy &quot; }); Dinos dino2 = new Dinos(new String[]{ &quot; __ &quot;, &quot; / _)&quot;, &quot; _/ / / _/ /&quot;, &quot; _| / &quot;, &quot; _| ( | ( | &quot;, &quot; /__.-&#39;|_|--|_| &quot;, &quot; Johnny &quot; }); Dinos dino3 = new Dinos(new String[]{ &quot; __ &quot;, &quot; / _)&quot;, &quot; _.-._/ / &quot;, &quot; _| / &quot;, &quot; _| ( | ( | &quot;, &quot; /__.-&#39;|_|--|_| &quot;, &quot; Jackson &quot; }); Dinos dino4 = new Dinos(new String[]{ &quot; __ &quot;, &quot; / _)&quot;, &quot; _/ / / _/ /&quot;, &quot; _| / &quot;, &quot; _| ( | ( | &quot;, &quot; /__.-&#39;|_|--|_| &quot;, &quot; James &quot; }); Dinos.printPoem(); } } Dinos.main(null); . 5 dinos strolling around __ __ __ __ __ / _) / _) / _) / _) / _) _/ / / _/ / _.-._/ / _/ / / _/ / _.-._/ / _/ / / _/ / _| / _| / _| / _| / _| / _| ( | ( | _| ( | ( | _| ( | ( | _| ( | ( | _| ( | ( | /__.-&#39;|_|--|_| /__.-&#39;|_|--|_| /__.-&#39;|_|--|_| /__.-&#39;|_|--|_| /__.-&#39;|_|--|_| Jimmy Jeremy Johnny Jackson James A meteor came down and bumped a head Uh Oh!

As you can see it&#39;s a pretty cool conversion to a more object-orientated version, alllowing the programmer to add more monkeys pretty easily by creating another object. Although I literally copied and pasted the code to print the actual poem, most of the new stuff comes from the static 2d ArrayList, which adds the monkey from each new instance to it, making it easy to edit. You can also get rid of a monkey at the very end (or at a specific index) and you can print out the individual monkey stored in one of the objects. Pretty efficient in my opinion. . Good job me. .",

            "content": "Kinematics . Kinematics deals with motion in a single dimension. Left to right, Up to down, something like that. While it may seem quite restricting right now (after all we live in 3 dimenstions), it’s important to be able to describe a single dimension before describing 3. Fundamentals are important in every field, and physics is no exception. . So in this post, I just want to review 4 key equations that are central to kinematics. . The Kinematic Equations . Below are the 4 essential equations to kinematics (assuming acceleration is constant): . . Let’s go through each of them in order. . This is a pretty basic equation, and quite self-explanatory to say the least. The final velocity of an object is equal to the initial velocity plus the acceleration times time. Well, acceleration times time is just change in velocity. So, adding change in velocity to inital velocity is just final velocity. . | This one’s a bit more complicated, but I’ll try to explain. Taking the average velocity (final plus initial over 2) and multiplying it by the time should yield displacement, because it’s similar to just rearranging the way to calculate area on a velocity graph. Just like how the formula for an arithmetic series works. . | This equation is pretty complicated, but I think I have an idea. Initial velocity times time just represents the bottom rectangle under a velocity graph, while acceleration times time squared divided by 2 just represents the triangle above that (acceleration times time represents change in velocity or the vertical height between initial and final on the graph, time just represents the horizontal length). . | I’m going to be honest, I don’t even know where to start on this one. I’ll probably figure it out later and edit this post. But for now, enjoy this picture of a sloth: . | .",

Basically, this video talks about the prevalence of stress and anxiety among students across many colleges and the need to reform their attitudes in order to live a good life. It’s clear that it’s not healthy for so many students to be stressed about going to a good college because they’re missing out on so many of the opportunities that they came there for in the first place. . Personal Experiences and Opinions . Personally, I can relate to some of the feelings that these students go through. I sometimes feel stressed when I have a lot of work to get done, feeling overwhelmed by everything I have to do. But I can’t even imagine what’d it be like to have to experience that all the time. So I do think that it’s necessary to make sure that those students are actually enjoying their lives in college. . In my opinion, living a good life in college would mean being able to pursue everything you want without having to deal with the restrictions that held you back as a child. Although this may come with more responsibilities, you still shouldn’t be weighed down by so much stress and anxiety for your classes. It just makes the college experience a bad memory later in the future, which could also possibly be jeopardized by that bad experience. Suffering mentally can prevent you from taking advantage of all the opportunities available, which could potentially lead to meeting amazing people or finding a dream job. . It’s tragic that so many students could potentially be missing out on so many of these opportunities which could do so much for them later in life. Reforming the college system to ensure that students are working hard AND happy should be a top priority for colleges across the nation. Because, after all, those students will have the biggest impact in the future after college. .",

Code.org Unitt 4 section 1 to 5 can help with some ideas. | AP Classroom unit 3 has outline for unit | CodeAcademy has some online resources | Personal hacks . If Statements . If statements are, in my opinion, at the core of all conditional statements. Essentially, whatever comes inside if statements only runs if the expression inside the if statement evaluates to be true. Otherwise, the code inside will not run and will move on. . If the programmer wants to create other code to run in a false case, then they have the else statement to use in an if-else statement. Else statements only run if the if statement evalulates to false. . If statements can be chained in succession using the if-elseif-else statement. The if and else components work exactly the same, but the elseif part can be thought of as a combination between the two. Elseif only runs if the if (or another elseif) satement before evalulates to false and the expression inside the elseif evalulates to true. These elseif statements can be stacked over and over again to handle all sorts of different cases. . Taken altogether, these three statements can be used to handle every sort of conditional case imaginable. It may be a bit confusing to have it explained on text, but it&#39;s much easier to just use actual code to demonstrate: . public class ifTest { public static void main(String[] args) { int numberOne = 5; // if statement // Since numberOne (5) is greater than 1, then it evaluates to be true and the print statement below runs if (numberOne &gt; 1) { System.out.println(numberOne + &quot; is greater than 1!&quot;); } // if-else statement // Since numberOne (5) is not greater than 9, then it evalulates to be false and then the else portion runs instead of the if if (numberOne &gt; 9) { System.out.println(numberOne + &quot; is greater than 9!&quot;); } else { System.out.println(numberOne + &quot; is not greater than 9!&quot;); } // if-elseif-else statement // numberOne (5) is not equal to 1, so the else-if runs next. Since numberOne (5) is equal to 5, then the code under else-if runs if (numberOne == 1) { System.out.println(&quot;numberOne is equal to 1!&quot;); } else if (numberOne == 5) { System.out.println(&quot;numberOne is equal to 5!&quot;); } else { System.out.println(&quot;I don&#39;t know what numberOne is!&quot;); } } } ifTest.main(null); . 5 is greater than 1! 5 is not greater than 9! numberOne is equal to 5! . A lot of elseif statements . You can see in the below example how a lot of elseif statements can be chained together for something like an if-elseif-elseif-elseif-elseif-else statement. The example below may be quite long, but there are other things you can do to simplify this: . public class elseifStatements { public static void main(String[] args) { String favoriteColor = &quot;green&quot;; if (favoriteColor.equals(&quot;red&quot;)) { System.out.println(&quot;The favorite color is red!&quot;); } else if (favoriteColor.equals(&quot;orange&quot;)) { System.out.println(&quot;The favorite color is orange!&quot;); } else if (favoriteColor.equals(&quot;yellow&quot;)) { System.out.println(&quot;The favorite color is yellow!&quot;); } else if (favoriteColor.equals(&quot;green&quot;)) { System.out.println(&quot;The favorite color is green!&quot;); } else if (favoriteColor.equals(&quot;blue&quot;)) { System.out.println(&quot;The favorite color is blue!&quot;); } else if (favoriteColor.equals(&quot;purple&quot;)) { System.out.println(&quot;The favorite color is purple!&quot;); } else { System.out.println(&quot;I don&#39;t know what the favorite color is!&quot;); } } } elseifStatements.main(null); . The favorite color is green! . Switch Cases . Switch cases are similar to if statements in that they run certain lines of code when certain conditions are true. However, switch cases only run when a prespecified variable is equal to whatever is given in each of the cases. . Why would I use this? Well, they can be more efficient than writing a ton of elseif statements. . This is also a bit confusing to explain through text, so here&#39;s another example (note how break is used to prevent everything below it from running): . public class switchTest { public static void main(String[] args) { String favoriteColor = &quot;green&quot;; switch (favoriteColor) { case &quot;red&quot;: System.out.println(&quot;The favorite color is red!&quot;); break; case &quot;orange&quot;: System.out.println(&quot;The favorite color is orange!&quot;); break; case &quot;yellow&quot;: System.out.println(&quot;The favorite color is yellow!&quot;); break; case &quot;green&quot;: System.out.println(&quot;The favorite color is green!&quot;); break; case &quot;blue&quot;: System.out.println(&quot;The favorite color is blue!&quot;); break; case &quot;purple&quot;: System.out.println(&quot;The favorite color is purple!&quot;); break; default: System.out.println(&quot;I don&#39;t know what the favorite color is!&quot;); } } } switchTest.main(null); . The favorite color is green! . De Morgan&#39;s Law . De Morgan&#39;s Law is a bit more mathematical in nature, dealing with set theory, so I&#39;ll try my best to describe it here. . De Morgan&#39;s Law basically explains how certain boolean statements can be rewritten as different expressions, yet essentially be the same. More specifically, it states that &quot;The complement of the union of two sets is the same as the intersection of their complements&quot; or &quot;The complement of the intersection of two sets is the same as the union of their complements&quot;. . What the heck does that mean? An easier way to think about it would be like this: . not (A or B) = (not A) and (not B) | not (A and B) = (not A) or (not B) | . In a more formalalized, mathematical way: . . But even with all that text, it&#39;s still pretty confusing, right? So it&#39;s probably best to visualize it using an actual image. This one I found online pretty much summarizes it best: . . The green shaded area is basically what&#39;s being covered in each equality. Both sides cover the same thing. . Finally, let&#39;s go through an example of how this would apply in code. Essentially, we&#39;ll use a few variables to make a whole bunch of complicated boolean statements that actually mean the same exact thing: . public class deMorgansLaw { public static void main(String[] args) { boolean a = false; boolean b = true; // These two statements are exactly equal according to De Morgan&#39;s law // In this case, the only way to yield an output of true would be to have both a and b to be false (change it to check) System.out.println(!(a || b)); System.out.println(!a &amp;&amp; !b); boolean c = true; boolean d = false; // These two statements are also exactly equal according to De Morgan&#39;s Law // In this case, the only way to yield an output of false would be to have both c and d to be true (change it to check) System.out.println(!(c &amp;&amp; d)); System.out.println(!c || !d); } } deMorgansLaw.main(null); . false false true true . Conclusion . If statements, elseif statements, and else statmenet are the most basic components of conditionals, and thus are essential for any programmer to understand. They allow programs to run different lines of codes depending on given conditions, letting a program do various things when run multiple times. . Switch statements are similar to if statements, but are more tailored towards testing a single variable. However, they can be more efficient than branching many if and elseif statements. . De Morgan&#39;s Law describes the more mathematical complexities of if statements, explaining how certain conditions are actually equal to certain others. These can allow a programmer to rewrite their code or reexamine how it works. . Overall, knowing all of these things can be super helpful in one&#39;s journey as a programmer. To finish things off, I made a simple guessing number game below, applying conditionals to check victory, defeat, and more. . import java.util.*; public class guessANumber { public static void main(String[] args) { Scanner input; int guessNumber = 0; int guesses = 5; int secretNumber = (int)((Math.random() * 100) + 1); while (true) { input = new Scanner(System.in); System.out.println(&quot;You have &quot; + guesses + &quot; guesses left!&quot;); System.out.println(&quot;Guess a number (1-100): &quot;); guessNumber = input.nextInt(); input.close(); if (guessNumber == secretNumber) { System.out.println(&quot;You guessed it! The secret number was &quot; + secretNumber + &quot;!&quot;); break; } else if (guessNumber &gt; secretNumber) { System.out.println(guessNumber + &quot; is too high!&quot;); guesses--; } else if (guessNumber &lt; secretNumber) { System.out.println(guessNumber + &quot; is too low!&quot;); guesses--; } if (guesses &lt;= 0) { System.out.println(&quot;You lose! The secret number was &quot; + secretNumber + &quot;!&quot;); break; } } } } guessANumber.main(null); . You have 5 guesses left! Guess a number (1-100): 50 is too low! You have 4 guesses left! Guess a number (1-100): 75 is too high! You have 3 guesses left! Guess a number (1-100): 63 is too low! You have 2 guesses left! Guess a number (1-100): 70 is too high! You have 1 guesses left! Guess a number (1-100): You guessed it! The secret number was 66! .",

            "title": "The Trajectory Calculator",
            "content": "The Trajectory Calculator . As my teamate (Andrew Meng) and I were wondering what to create for our GUI project, we eventually stumbled into the realm of physics. Originally, we wanted to create a kinematics simulator, but we soon realized how hard that would actually be. Apparently, real time updates take a lot of effort to implement. . Our next idea would be the one we chose - a trajectory calculator. The idea was simple: ask the user for inputs on velocity, angle, and height and the program would output a graph of the trajectory of the object. So, we soon got to work on implementing it. . Bailey’s Part . My part in creating it centered around the fundamental part of the idea - the mathematics. I realized that a class had to be made to handle all of the mathematical operations behind the trajectory, so I created TrajectoryMath.java to take care of all of that. . TrajectoryMath takes in parameters of velocity, degrees, and height to perform all of the calculations. Once the object is created, it’s able to return the equation in double or String format, the positive root (when the equation is equal to 0), and each of the coefficients for the equation. . Without this mathematical framework, the graph wouldn’t be able to output anything useful at all. . Andrew’s Part . Andrew’s part in creating it centered around the GUI portion of the process, making it interactive so that a user could input values and have the program spit out a graph as the output. He created two files, InputInitial.java and TrajectoryGraph.java to handle the inputs and graphing respectively. . InputInitial essentially creates a prompt for the user to input the velocity, degrees, and height for the equation. It also takes care of error handling with faulty inputs. . TrajectoryGraph is probably the central file of the entire operation, as it runs the entire program. It creates an object of the InputInitial class to get the inputs, and takes each of those inputs as parameters for the drawGraph() method. This method creates an object of the TrajectoryMath class to deal with the math and then takes values from that and uses it as inputs to create a graph using JFrame. . Without this interactive structure, the user wouldn’t even be able to input and see anything at all. . Conclusion . This project was a lot bigger than expected, and we ran into quite a few problems along the way. But I found it very fun to create a big project that actually has a cool purpose. I also really felt that I grew a lot during this project, as it was a new experience to deal with multiple Java files and complicated packages. Overall, it was a fun experience. . .",

Arrays can store multiples values of a datatype, indicated by the form: . “type[] arrayName;” . Various values can be stored within, making it a useful tool to handle large amounts of data. . For and while loops . Arrays can also be transversed, iterated, and mutated through for and while loops. Using these loops, each element inside the array can be accessed and/or changed somehow. It’s way easier than just using a million variables and going through each one. . To access each value, simply use the square brackets along with the index (which starts from 0). An example of accessing something at index 2 would like like this . “arrayOfNumbers[2];” . Conclusion . Arrays are useful for handling large amounts of data neatly. .",

            "content": "My Journey . Programming has always been quite a large part of my life. For a while, I never really thought about why. So that’s why I want to take a look back from the start. . The Beginning . I think I’ve always been interested in programming for as long as I could remember. My dad was a software engineer at HP, so if I had to say, my passion probably came from him. It was fun watching him type up copius amounts of code (which he still does), many parts of which I still wouldn’t understand to this day. . Block Coding . Like many others, my first real experience with programming probably came from block coding from sites such as code.org (hour of code) and Scratch. But it’s very common for a good reason. Block coding can easily teach the fundamentals of programming without the difficult learning curve of syntax. I still remember all the puzzles where I had to get my character (like Steve from Minecraft) to move somewhere and do something (like attack with a sword). . . Python . The first actual language I learned was Python on a site called Codecademy. Python was and still is a pretty good choice for beginners, due to its very forgiving syntax (although why would any language use indent as part of its syntax). There are (usually) no annoying methods or functions I need to know to do basic things and a lot of the processes are automatically performed by the compiler. However, due to it being a high-level language, efficiency is a lot lower than other languages. Plus, there was no reason to use its object-orientated programming syntax over other languages like C++ and Java. . C++ . C++ was quite a challenge to learn, as it was the first object-orientated language I tried to fully learn (I gave up on Java earlier). Learning how classes and objects operated was quite different from what I normally used in languages like Python, but it was well worth it. Knowing how to use objects and classes can be very powerful, as they basically allow anyone to create their own variable with custom properties. (I also “learned” how to use pointers, which can be its own topic). . . Today . Today, I am still code code coding in APCSA, picking up old things and learning new things. I’ve picked Java back up again as the main language we use (more successfully with my knowledge of C++) and I’ve learned how to use sites like GitHub, which can be useful for making huge projects with many collaborators. . Where To? . Obviously, my journey is still ongoing. I still have plans for other avenues, which I’ll probably start working on soon. Even though it’s been a long time since I’ve started programming, I still feel that I barely know anything, which is a good thing. Knowing less means that there’s more to learn. With all the time in the world, I’ll continue to grow as a programmer and maybe make some super cool things. . For now, I’ll just keep working on Java and Github though. .",

It’s especially important to go over the creation and use of objects along with the inheritance of classes. . Objects . Objects are the main feature of java, and they represent instances of a class (a blueprint for these objects). Objects are unique in the way that they can have their own attributes and methods, allowing the programmer who makes the class to tailor their objects to certain specifications. By calling their methods (with the dot operator), a programmer can use objects to perform tasks. . Here’s an example of using an object to paint certain things in code.org: Note how the object is established with “PainterPlus myPainterPlus = new PainterPlus();” and how it accesses its methods such as myPainter.moveFast(); . Inheritance . One cool feature about classes in java is that class can inherit certain properties and methods from other classes. Members of the child class are able to access the same attributes and methods of the parent class, in the same way for both. Through this, programmers can create a very general parent class as a blueprint for more specific classes detailing attributes and methods specific to that class, while keeping the essential attributes and methods of the original. . Here’s an example of a class, PainterPlus, inheriting from the class Painter in code.org: Note how the class declaration of PainterPlus includes the “extends” keyword in order to inherit from Painter. . Here’s an example of how PainterPlus can use methods from both classes in code.org: Note how .move() is a method of Painter, while .turnRight() is a method exclusive to PainterPlus. .",

For example, what if you wanted to know the Fibonacci number at a certain index? Recursion can help. . How does recursion work? . Recursion occurs when a function calls itself as a part of its executables, meaning that it will be called numerous times when just calling it once. What does this look like? An easy example to show would be a method to find a certain number in the Fibonacci sequence: . public int fibonacciNumber(int termNumber) { . if (termNumber == 1) { . return 0; . } else if (termNumber == 2) { . return 1; . } else { . return this.fibonacciNumber(termNumber - 1) + this.fibonacciNumber(termNumber - 2); . } . } . Essentially, this function will try to find the value of a certain term in the Fibonacci sequence by adding its two previous values. This loops over and over again until reaching the first 2 numbers in the sequence, 0 and 1, which will be returned and make their way back up to the term number inputted by the user. Though this can be quite inefficient at larger amounts, it’s still a good example on how it can be implemented as a solution. .",

Mainly, it serves to control the version history of the many files in a project. . . How does GitHub work? . GitHub organizes projects into repositories, which are the main centers of controlling versions. When changes are made to one of the files, a programmer must make a “push” request (along with a quick message about it), which is basically asking the repository to review the changes and accept it, which is called “committing”. This is pretty useful for larger programs, as it’s important to keep track of all the changes made to a software (in case catastrophic errors occur in a sea of files). Though, on a smaller scale, it’s more tedious. GitHub can be linked to other softwares such as VSCode in order to make changes and push requests directly from there. . Summary .

This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code .
