<p>For our final for APCSA trimester one, we had to take a test on college board on crucial concepts in Java.
I got 33/40, which still gets me 100% in the class, but these are the corrections for the 7 questions I missed.</p>

<h2 id="question-22">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-22" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 22</h2>

<p><img src="/congenial-tribble/images/q22p1.png" alt="Question 22 Part 1">
<img src="/congenial-tribble/images/q22p2.png" alt="Question 22 Part 2"></p>

<p>I got this question wrong because I thought that you had to specify a method would be overriden when creating a 
new function in the child class with the same method signature as a function in the parent class. However, this
was wrong. That’s why D is wrong.</p>

<p>My other mistake was that I didn’t realize that, since books only takes in a list of the object Book, using a 
child class AudioBook to create an object in the list is valid, but it’ll only be considered as a Book and will 
be unable to access methods unique to its child class. That’s why the correct answer is B, because books[0] can’t 
access methods that are in the child class.</p>

<h2 id="question-28">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-28" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 28</h2>

<p><img src="/congenial-tribble/images/q28.png" alt="Question 28"></p>

<p>I’m not exactly sure why I got this wrong, but I think it’s because I thought the loop would always run, therefore x would 
never be equal 1 after the loop, which is false, because n can be given a value less than 2. That’s why B is wrong.</p>

<p>E is right because the conditions for the loop to run necessitates that n is greater than 2, therefore it’ll always be greater 
than 2 inside the loop.</p>

<h2 id="question-34">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-34" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 34</h2>

<p><img src="/congenial-tribble/images/q34p1.png" alt="Question 34 Part 1">
<img src="/congenial-tribble/images/q34p2.png" alt="Question 34 Part 2"></p>

<p>I don’t know why I got this question wrong. I realized that I wouldn’t work because it never sets the center point and III 
wouldn’t work because the Circle class can’t access private attributes, but I still chose the wrong answer. I think I just
misclicked.</p>

<h2 id="question-35">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-35" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 35</h2>

<p><img src="/congenial-tribble/images/q35.png" alt="Question 35"></p>

<p>I got this question wrong because I forgot to consider result * 10 in the reassignment of result. I thought that the program 
simply summed up the digits in the number, which is why I chose 18. But result * 10 actually means that the digits in the 
number are being switched around, which is why 4752 is the right answer.</p>

<h2 id="question-38">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-38" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 38</h2>

<p><img src="/congenial-tribble/images/q38.png" alt="Question 38"></p>

<p>I got this question wrong because I forgot to consider that y being greater than 10000 is not necessary for the expression 
to evaluate to be true. My response does evaluate to true if y &gt; 10000, but I forgot that the other conditions of x &lt; 1500 
and x &gt; 1000 can also be true to make the expression evaluate to be true.</p>

<p>Option A does consider both of these options, which is why it’s the correct answer.</p>

<h2 id="question-39">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-39" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 39</h2>

<p><img src="/congenial-tribble/images/q39.png" alt="Question 39"></p>

<p>This question was really hard for me. The double recursion made things super confusing for me, until I realized that the loop 
of recursion would continue until n was less than or equal to 10. I thought that the answer must be less than 10, which is why 
I chose 8, but I forgot to realize it would multiple it by 2 one last time before returning n, which is why 16 is actually the 
right answer.</p>

<h2 id="question-40">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-40" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 40</h2>

<p><img src="/congenial-tribble/images/q40.png" alt="Question 40"></p>

<p>I didn’t realize that the program would print temp instead of the original string, which is why I thought it would still print 
“WATCH” at the end and not just “WATC”. That’s why Option C is the right answer and not Option D.</p>
