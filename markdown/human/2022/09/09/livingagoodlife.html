<p>Basically, this video talks about the prevalence of stress and anxiety among students across many colleges and the need
to reform their attitudes in order to live a good life. It’s clear that it’s not healthy for so many students to be 
stressed about going to a good college because they’re missing out on so many of the opportunities that they came there 
for in the first place.</p>

<h2 id="personal-experiences-and-opinions">
<a class="anchor" href="#personal-experiences-and-opinions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Personal Experiences and Opinions</h2>

<p>Personally, I can relate to some of the feelings that these students go through. I sometimes feel stressed when I have a lot 
of work to get done, feeling overwhelmed by everything I have to do. But I can’t even imagine what’d it be like to have to 
experience that all the time. So I do think that it’s necessary to make sure that those students are actually enjoying their 
lives in college.</p>

<p>In my opinion, living a good life in college would mean being able to pursue everything you want without having to deal with 
the restrictions that held you back as a child. Although this may come with more responsibilities, you still shouldn’t be 
weighed down by so much stress and anxiety for your classes. It just makes the college experience a bad memory later in the 
future, which could also possibly be jeopardized by that bad experience. Suffering mentally can prevent you from taking 
advantage of all the opportunities available, which could potentially lead to meeting amazing people or finding a dream job.</p>

<p>It’s tragic that so many students could potentially be missing out on so many of these opportunities which could do so much 
for them later in life. Reforming the college system to ensure that students are working hard AND happy should be a top 
priority for colleges across the nation. Because, after all, those students will have the biggest impact in the future after 
college.</p>
